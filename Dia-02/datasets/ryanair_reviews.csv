Ryanair in both directions was bang on time and smooth flights in both directions.  We always sit in Front for more space and this was very comfortable for just under a 3 hour flight. The cabin crew were polite and efficient with nice sense of humour especially and engagement especially Ethan and his female colleague at the front section.

I booked the seat with Ryanair several months before my planned travel and found the website clear and easy to use. Ryanair sent quite frequent emails relating to the flight and attempted to sell me extras. The check-in procedure was followed by a bag-drop at Faro Airport. This was not efficient and the app they recommended for speedy bag-drop did not work. Setting that aside, I was able to check-in my bag within less than 30 minutes of having arrived at the airport. Boarding was supposedly via group but this did not materialise at all. The cabin crew had a reasonable presence and delivered a serious safety procedure. During the flight the crew worked hard and had several rounds of drinks for sale. I found the seat suitable for a flight just under 3 hours. The flight departed on-time and arrived on schedule too. Disembarkation was delayed in Liverpool while this was not the fault of Ryanair, there was no communication with the passengers as to why this was the case. Disembarkation was not orderly and was poorly managed. Overall, a decent offering from Ryanair.",Boeing 737,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Faro,Liverpool,January 2024,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,yes,,

The flight itself was 57 euro. They almost charged me the price of the flight just to check me in manually! And they forced me to check in manually by closing online and self-serve checkin.

6,2024-01-03,5,United Kingdom,Not Verified,"""they are really not better value""","The flight itself is operated by Malta air and I've always found their cabin crew to be very pleasant and respectful. That however cannot be said for their handling agents either in Pisa or Stansted. The Stansted bunch I have found to be rude, argumentative and hostile. Like they hate their work. Boarding no matter where is a shambles. You're invariably stuck in a freezing cold or roasting hot stairwell even before your aircraft reaches the gate. It's not a pleasant experience. Nowhere to sit. As budget airlines don't use jetties at the gate there is every chance that you're gonna get soaked going to and from the terminal in winter. Cabins are not the worst that I've been on. I'm a wee guy so 2hrs 30mins isn't too bad. As far as cheap fares go, I've yet to get a Ryaniar flight that I found to be value for money. All I can say about the flights is that they are generally uneventful and again the Malta Air crew are welcoming. I found that once you add on all of their ridiculous charges they are really not better value than companies like British Airways.

So we missed our flight, and they made us pay a No show fee on the application so that they give us another flight in the evening. The flight we got was about 30 Euro and the no show fee we paid was 100 Euro. When I told them in Germany we can pay by debit card or cash, they said we are an Irish airline it has nothing to do with Germany! Then why do you have your business here?

There is basically no way anymore that you can convincingly plan longer trips with them, for example a train journey after arrival, because you never know when you arrive. Today, we are loosing another train ticket that we bought ages ago in advance, when we still believed that some delays are exceptions to the rule, rather than the new rule. Even back then, we already calculated with a one and a half hour Ryanair delay, but that is just not good enough for that ""never on time airline"". To make things worse, according to EU law, they only have to pay compensation from a three hour delay, i.e. most delays go without any sanction, meaning a contribution from Ryanair for the additional expenses their customer have to pay. Long live neoliberalism? Add to that the non-existing Ryanair customer-sevice, which leaves you in the dark about new departure time, gate changes etc, and you have the worst package you can possibly buy. What can we customers do about it? At first, let us please stop buying drinks, food and other items on flights that come with more than half an hour delay. We should not reward such an airline for what they do to us.

Outbound flight on time, clean aircraft and Cabin Crew friendly and well presented. Great value for money. It was cheaper to fly to Dublin for the day on Ryanair rather than go to London from Bristol for the day by rail. Although the seats do not recline, I thought the leg room was fine. I have flown Ryanair several times over the years and have come to the conclusion that as long as you stick to the rules with regards checking in on line and adhere to luggage sizes, journeys are hassle free generally. Flight was late on the return leg but they emailed an apology before the dedicated check in time. That didn’t bother me personally. Their website is designed to capture more money related to seat allocation, earlier checkin, luggage upgrades, insurance, etc etc but they are optional and as long as you know what you want, there is no obligation to increase the price of your journey.

17,2023-11-02,9,United Kingdom,Not Verified,"""Play the game and you'll be fine""","Play the game and you'll be fine. Got a return flight from Leeds Bradford to Faro for £101. I booked 3 months ahead, didn't reserve a seat, and took only a small bag. Had my boarding pass both on my app, and in paper format (just in case). Took my own food and drink on the plane, didn't buy any of theirs, and didn't buy any of their duty free etc. It really does pay to do your research. At Leeds Bradford someone had lost their boarding pass (I think that cost them £60), while at Faro someone's cabin bag was too big. That had to go in the hold, and I expect that cost him. He said it was OK at Leeds, but maybe he got away with it there. My old bag would have been too big, but I checked Ryanair's website, and bought a new and conforming bag for £9.99. I'm 6 foot tall, and the leg room is tight, but just about OK for a 3 hour flight. The seats were uncomfortable though and needed more cushioning. The outward flight took off and arrived on time. The cabin crew were friendly and efficient. No hard sales pitch for food, drink, duty free. The announcements could have been clearer, but that was down to the Portuguese captain. The return flight was about an hour late taking off, due to delays experienced earlier in the day. This happens. Allow for it. They made up 20 minutes and the plane landed at Leeds Bradford 40 minutes behind schedule. Absolutely no complaints whatsoever and fantastic value for money. I'd reckon that the negative views on here are hugely in the minority. In some cases things have gone wrong, but in others part of the blame must be with the posters who haven't researched and prepared well.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Leeds,Faro,October 2023,3.0,4.0,,4.0,5.0,yes,,

However, often flying with Ryanair is a tiring thing. The boarding process can simply be a pain as between scanning your pass and effectively letting you on the plane they let passengers stand in line for long time, often in cramped places. Surely it is to assure everyone is there, can board quickly and enable the closing of the doors of the plane on time, but is quite a torture (many other airlines try to avoid such thing, probably with more differentiation of boarding groups). Furthermore, on this specific flight, the crew truly was a pain trying to sell all kind of “Duty Free” (non existing, as it was a domestic flight) items. The announcements took a full 10 minutes on a 60 min flight (sum it up with the safety instructions, buy on board of catering items, pilot’s message(s) etc), reading out all kind of “special offers” for more or less low ranking articles and was loud.

42,2023-08-12,6,Morocco,Trip Verified,"""they give such cheap tickets""","I would like to point out that the airline is a 'Budget airline' and it's pretty popular in Europe and north Africa, and RYANAIR is the most well known of them all for various reasons (mostly negative). BOOKING AND CHECK-IN: To book your flight like every other airline you do it online, through their website or their own app, booking a flight is easy enough and the first thing that will surprise you is how cheap tickets can get, some goes for less than 20 Euros, and many of them don't go over 100 Euros (depending on when you're booking), although that's very good you soon realise why the airline is hated, as when you choose your ticket you're bombarded with fees left and right for everything else besides the ticket. You have a big bag you want to take with you? That would be 30€ extra. Want to bring a small cabin bag? You can only do that by buying priority Which is at least 25€...etc the only thing you can bring is one backpack for free that weighs less than 10kg. They also try to sell you on offers such as compensation etc, but for the most part it's absolutely not worth it, so don't spend your money on them. In terms of checking you can do it for free only when there's less than 24 hours left on the flight online, if you come to check in at the airport you'll be charged 30€ for them to check-in for you and give you the boarding pass, so keep that in mind! WAITING AND BOARDING: It's the day you take your flight! Remember that when you get through security, to look at the departures carefully, because 3 times out of ten they will change their gate (that's if they show you the gate early, they usually show it until there's less than an hour for the planes departure), stay alert! After that you during boarding you must wait until it's your turn (if you don't have priority) and go to your plane! In the boarding pass you printed or given they will tell you where to board, because Ryanair uses both the front and the rear for boarding people, and rarely use normal gates. After you've boarded, sit, relax if you can, because the seats aren't the best and they aren't reclinable. The food is also not free so if you want anything you have to pay (they also don't accept cash, only cards). END OF TRIP: And there you go, you've survived the trip with (hopefully) little to no extra money spent! All and all as much as this review is negative in many aspects, to be completely fair you get what you pay for, if you know what you're doing already and/or made research to be prepared you shouldn't have any problems! It's a very good airline for the fact they give such cheap tickets to people like me (a student) who can't afford ""big airlines"" and can go with only a backpack! It's also a different story if you go with your family or friends as in my situation all my flights in Ryanair were solo! Just watch out for their scummy behaviour to extract more money and try to not book the flight on third party websites. For me I'll give it a solid 6/10 because for many people like me the airline is a life saver, but it's definitely not for everybody to use.",Boeing 737-800,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Rabat,Rome,August 2023,1.0,1.0,,2.0,4.0,yes,,

Ryanair has no ground staff to assist people which is why they can be 'budget'. We landed late at night and 3 other Ryanair flights also landed in Verona due to the storm. There was a very nice lady employed by Verona Airport who was helping all the Ryanair customers. We were told to wait for buses arranged by Ryanair to take people from Verona to Treviso airport. People were fighting to get on the buses and we didn't understand why anyone would behave that way, considering Ryanair must surely know exactly how many buses they need to send based on how many flights/passengers had landed. Well, we were wrong. We also felt we should have been the last to go on the bus since all 3 other planes had landed before us and waited much longer. There were 40 people still left and we were told that the last bus was coming but it could fit only 16 people.

Their actions made the journey highly inconvenient for my family and several other passengers. It seemed their main objective was to extract extra money from travelers for baggage, which created a tense and unpleasant atmosphere during boarding. The trouble began when a passenger in front of us was forced to pay for their bag, even though it appeared perfectly fine from our viewpoint. We voiced our concerns, hoping for some empathy from the crew member. Unfortunately, this only seemed to provoke them to target us next. On a hot day in Lisbon, we had placed our jackets in a foldable bag, adhering to the baggage policy. However, as we were being briefed on the rules, we put our jackets on. After a discussion with a colleague, the crew member allowed us to proceed. While in the queue, one of my daughters, who has asthma, removed her jacket and hat. Suddenly, the same crew member appeared, ordering us out of the line and threatening to deny us boarding. Despite explaining that nothing had changed since they had previously allowed us through, they remained stubborn. They called another crew member over, and both of them joined in a verbal assault. They disregarded the fact that the extra bags were gadgets belonging to my child and wife, insisting that we could only carry four bags. Their behavior was not only rude and disrespectful but also unprofessional, displaying personal animosity and complete disregard for our well-being. It was evident that this crew member was actively seeking an excuse to single us out and personally target us. Our attempts to explain were met with increasing firmness, dismissiveness, and even mockery. Their conduct left a lasting negative impression, overshadowing what should have been a smooth and stress-free journey. I am deeply disappointed that Ryanair employs individuals who lack professionalism and take their frustrations out on innocent customers. This experience was disheartening, leading me to question whether I would choose to fly with Ryanair in the future. The treatment we received was unacceptable, and I sincerely hope that the airline takes this feedback seriously and addresses the conduct of its crew members.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Lisbon,London,May 2023,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,no,,

Despite it not being mandatory to complete web check-in for my flight, I was unjustly charged a hefty fee of 40EUR due to an error on their part. Upon arriving at the airport, I was informed that I needed to pay the additional fee because I had not completed the web check-in process. However, according to Ryanair's own policy, web check-in is not mandatory, and passengers are still able to check in at the airport without incurring any charges. I found it incredibly unfair and frustrating that I was penalized for their own mistake. The customer service representative I approached for assistance was unhelpful and unsympathetic to my situation. They showed no willingness to resolve the issue or provide any explanation for the unnecessary charge. This lack of professionalism only added to my dissatisfaction. As a frequent flyer, I have had positive experiences with several other airlines that prioritize customer satisfaction and go above and beyond to rectify their mistakes. Unfortunately, Ryanair fell far short of these expectations. The incident left a sour taste in my mouth and has significantly impacted my perception of Ryanair as a reliable and customer-centric airline. The lack of transparency and the unwarranted charge have made me question their commitment to customer service and fairness. I strongly advise other travelers to be cautious when booking with Ryanair and to carefully review their policies and fees. It is disheartening to experience such disregard for customer satisfaction, and I hope that Ryanair takes this feedback constructively and works towards improving their service and rectifying their mistakes.

103,2023-04-21,1,United Kingdom,Trip Verified,"""Will never fly with Ryanair again""","I had thought Ryanair would have improved over the years, but I was completely wrong. The cheap flights are completely offset by added charges. Firstly with bags, the size they provide as acceptable cabin bags are miniscule - barely enough to fit a days worth of clothes and items - so we purchased a cabin bag. The cabin bag they allow is the size of a usual carry on; the small wheeled suitcases so many people use. However when we got to check in, everyone with us (after the priority boarding) had these suitcases with no problem? We paid to have a bag checked in, when everyone else carried theirs on with no problem. That was £55 extra. We then had to pay to sit next to each other, as I was travelling with my partner. We paid for this on one flight, and for the return flight we checked in as soon as online check in was open. Even though there were only a couple of seats already booked and the entire plane was empty, it deliberately seated us far apart in order to make us pay more. When it says they cannot guarantee you will be seated next to each other, take it to mean they will deliberately seat you far apart in order to get more money from you. Finally on the flight, having a flight attendant scream right next to you, as they yell at their colleague at the other end of the plane was interesting. Even more so was the aggressive way they do anything. I walk using a walking aid, and I called up to check this was ok before I boarded. After being told it was ok and that I would be able to keep the walking aid between my legs, an attendant roughly grabbed it on the flight and shoved it into an already full overhead locker, and then slammed it shut several times until it closed. This cracked and damaged the walking aid and I've now had to purchase another. When I submitted a complaint about this, I was told I needed to have filled in a particular form at the airport. I have never had an attendant damage the items I use to walk around before, and at no point does it say that if anything is damaged you need to fill in a form at the airport. I was then stuck in a loop of calling in to discuss this issue, being told to reply to an email and then being told they would do nothing as this form was not filled in.

The check-in staff at Fuerteventura airport were very professional and friendly too. Boarding was something of a mishap as there was no reinforcement of the priority boarding. This caused an upheaval as several passengers, rightly voiced their grievances over this. This was a very full flight including several family groups. The cabin crew were far more professional than on my outbound flight and imposed a strict no nuts regime as a passenger had a nut allergy. One crew member stood out from her peers, who was not only very professional but seemed to go the extra mile to assist an elderly couple and to help a lady who was unwell. This crew member is a great credit to Ryanair and deserves recognition for her professionalism and common sense. During the flight 2 to-buys drinks and snacks rounds were performed and again the crew did very well indeed. Although there was a delay of circa 50 minutes to departure this was communicated very well to the passengers. Disembarkation was quite something as a problem passengers stood up before landing and ignored instructions to sit down. This passenger rudely pushed his away along the aisle and brushed a cabin crew member aside. Astonishingly poor behaviour. The cabin crew should not have to deal with such appalling behaviour.

One lady seemed to do all the work while her colleagues took a back-seat attitude. I had a negative experience when I needed to use the lavatory. I politely asked a male member of the cabin crew if the lavatory was free? I am visually impaired. To my shock the staff member in question sighed and mumbled something in another language without answering my question. Disembarkation was a farce as the abusive woman and her brood pushed to the exit without any of the cabin crew correcting the dangerous behaviour eg standing up and removing bags from the locker before the flight had even properly landed.

Firstly, the website is logical and well set out stating the rules and policies of the airline. Follow the rules and there are no problems. I should like to commend the Check-in staff for their help and efficiency. I took a train from London to the Stansted airport unfortunately the luggage of another passenger ripped the top of my bag. The check-in staff noticed this rip and were very helpful towards me. Boarding the flight was another matter as there was a rather large group of Italian teenagers returning home to Italy. Their chaperones were badly organised and the Ryanair ground staff did not manage this well resulting in a delay to the flight of about forty minutes. None of the ground staff showed any initiative in this situation. None of the ground staff spoke any Italian and there was no effort to translate to the teenagers.  Passengers were allowed to queue in the bridge before the flight was ready to depart. There were steep stairs to be negotiated and I assisted an elderly passenger with the stairs as no warning had been given about the stairs. The security demonstration was reasonably well conducted. Service was lacklustre with one cabin crew yawning over her passengers and rolling her eyes and looked bored. The lovely lady who sat next to me ordered a prosecco and was gruffly handed her drink and a cracked plastic glass. The drink spilled over the lady and the male cabin crew showed no interest and seemed to expect the passenger to continue drinking from the cracked plastic glass. The male staff member had to be asked to find some paper towels and to replace the glass. He sighed indignantly when asked to do so. At one stage a member of the cabin crew locked the lavatory and caused a line to form. There was no apology or explanation either. The landing was fine but disembarkation was chaotic and poorly managed. Based on this experience, I would think twice about booking with this airline again. The ground staff were superb, friendly and polite and very helpful.

There isn't much room for a person who is overweight in 1 of Ryanair seats, they'll probably be uncomfortable for the whole flight, especially next to the window. Ryanair use Terminal 3. It's a no smoking terminal. Ryanair quote, ""low fares"", but they mean the starting price is a low fare. It soon adds up to cost just as much as easyjet or jet2. When you board or come off a Ryanair flight you'll find it's always up/down the steps not through the airbridge. When you're waiting for your suitcase. Expect to be waiting for at least 1 hour and 30 mins. Otherwise you might loose your mind and take it out on the wrong member of staff....like me. On our way home from Rome we arrived at the airport, got through security. I decided to check my phone to see where the plane was using Plane Finder. The answer to my question....Manchester. It had literally just taken off. We left nearly an hour late. During the flight we were told no food or drink available. Imagine if we purchased an inflight meal. We arrived at Manchester but spent 3 hours waiting for our bags because Swissport must've only had 3 people unloading each Ryanair flight. So we were 1 of 3 flights landed.

Regardless the staff sent us to the basement to buy a COVID rapid test. Within 20 minutes we were upstairs again with our results, but the two employees had closed the check in counter, after they had told us to run downstairs to get a test and then come back for our boarding passes.

The rest of our party had headed through security while we got our tests and approached the Ryanair staff on that side and told them our dilemma.

They told us we had to book new flights because no one was at the check in counter.

So I called NE again and they still said that they had no record of the reservation or payment, so I had to make a claim against my credit card company for a refund.

I’ve had my shares of bad experience with Ryanair but always thought “Well, my bad I should have been more prepared I guess” or “they are probably having a bad day, cut them some slack” etc. But if you’re going to be aggressive and verbally abusive to two senior travelers, then we’re going to have a real problem. Even more if the seniors in question are my parents who have a limited knowledge of English. My parents came to visit us this weekend. They arrived in London fully prepared, vaccinated, passports, forms, VeriFly app literally everything that was required and asked of them. They flew in with BA at Heathrow and everything went smoothly (take some notes Stansted!). Then we prepared their return journey and they made sure to book 2 handbags (that’s how it works now you have to pay for handbags too). So, prior to the trip they booked two ‘less than 10 kg handbags’ on the agency’s website which gave them also the right to priority board (something they were not aware of). They actually waited and queued until it was time to board and once in front of the person at the desk were asked to pay £90 for the two bags. My dad tried to explain he already paid for it, but she didn’t want to hear it, she laughed to their faces because they tried to explain themselves with the few English words they know, and then she realized that my dad speaks Spanish (apparently, she did too) so they managed to understand each other to some extent. She lost patience and told my parents it was either they paid for the bags, or they had to leave them behind. Scared and tired by the situation they decided to pay and after they got the confirmation and the sticky tag on their bags asked if they could get an invoice or receipt. The lady said she didn’t have it and that they will receive it by email. However never confirmed it with my dad and asked them to quickly move towards the plane and embark. Then someone - I'm guessing who's a security person - yelled at them in the corridor in English (remember a language they don't understand) and kept screaming and shouting at them for a good minute without thinking they might not be able to understand his language. Literally no patience, no kindness, no respect. My parents managed to connect the dots and gathered that he wanted them to leave the bags outside the plane (remember small handbags less than 10 kg) they pointed a corner to him, and he let out some kind of agreeing grunt. Then once on board they probably were thinking they could finally relax, but no, once again someone with a lot of empathy and sympathy decided otherwise. The hostess that day kept asking my mum to remove her jacket, and put it up in the overhead bin, then underneath the seat, then finally take it back and put it on her knees because it wasn’t right, and every 5 minutes came back to check if she was ""cooperating"" because she also asked my mum to remove her scarf and for some reason it needed to be left with the jacket. What is wrong in your head? When a lady of a certain age is cold, you pressure her into removing her clothes? First, I don’t get what the security hazard is with a scarf. Second, it’s literally freezing outside, and we know how cold it can be inside the plane before take-off, also ever heard of covid. I mean come on.

279,2021-11-12,1,United States,Trip Verified,"""Extremely unsatisfied with the lack of help""","Our flight from Crete to Athens started off with online check-in issues. We followed the prompts, but there was no option for check in, only to cancel or change flight. We even watched a video but never was presented with a check in option on the mobile website. When we arrived at the airport, we spoke to one of the employees at the bag check line, and explained to her our issue with online check in. She offered no help or advice, only said there is nothing for her to do and that we must pay €55 each to print our tickets or we could speak to her coworker at a Skyserv help desk. We proceeded to the alternate employee at the Skyserv booth and once again explained our troubles with online check in. We even showed her the step by step process in which we tried to check in on our mobile phone. She started to raise her voice and said “I don’t know why you’re the only people having an issue. Other customers don’t have this issue. It’s clearly something you did wrong!” Instead of providing us with actual help and presenting a fix to the issue that we physically showed her on the phone, she was dismissive, blaming us, and outright rude. When we wished to escalate the matter, she refused to tell us her name and began acting even more erratic. She stated that “Ryanair will know who I am and I don’t have to give you any information.” At this point we were forced into making one of two decisions - miss our flight or pay €55 for each boarding pass. Extremely unsatisfied with the lack of help, we returned to the bag check desk, and decided to go ahead with the payment. At our second interaction with the bag check staff, we were informed that the price per boarding pass is now €62.50! We showed them the Ryanair email that said it was €55 and explained to said staff that she told us ten minutes prior that it was a €55 fee. The employee told us to look at her screen if we have an issue, because that’s what it says and she could give no explanation for the discrepancy in Ryanair email or what we were previously told. At this point we were uncomfortably coerced into choosing to either miss our flight or pay this new arbitrary price that no employee could give an explanation for. No one can explain to us why we were unable to check in online and no one can explain to us why there was an increase in price after this entire debacle. Fast forward two months after this incident and multiple complaints to Ryanair, they finally responded with again no resolution. A representative from Ryanair emailed stating, ""At first, I would like to express our sympathy regarding the circumstances resulting in you being unable to have done the check-in online. However, if a customer does not manage to check-in online then an airport check-in fee of €55/£55 per person is applied."" This acknowledges our inability to check-in, but somehow still place the blame on the customer. When questioned about why we were arbitrary told to pay €62.50 by the bag check staff when Ryanair and this representative's email clearly stated €55, another rep responded back with, ""Unfortunately, as per the previous responses you have received, our standpoint remains unaltered that means according to our agreed Terms and Conditions Article 10.1 all monies paid towards Ryanair are non-refundable."" So again no explanation. It really feels like a ""you have to pay whatever amount we tell you or you get to miss your flight"" situation.

This time though I felt it's important to share. I do not recommend to buy tickets with them now in time of COVID.

I supposed to fly to Bologna from Prague, pre condition is to have a PCR test not older than 3 days. My husband got positive and obviously we had to go to quarantine. I reached out ryanair and only option available was actually to change flights, but for every option they were charging full price extra for luggage (it's 40 euro on top of 50 I have already paid for luggage) and therefore any option I was extra I have to pay to keep tickets was way higher than to buy completely new. So I've asked if there is a way to cancel and get at least something back even through voucher to use it for other flight, but 150 euro of one ticket thrown away. But in this particular case it's cheating on clients: we are doing here tests on weekly base and you cannot predict to get Covid before flight if you were fine week before and extra nearly full charge for luggage on top is really stealing money.

I was supposed to check in my luggage since I had also a small backpack and Ryanair policies do not allow the carry on of two pieces of luggage on board (the check in of this second bag was included in the ticket that I bought). While I was waiting in line (there were 50 people before me) the check in for Eindhoven suddenly closed without any announcements and I was not able to check in my extra luggage. The Ryanair lady at the counter told me that there was nothing that could be done, she told me to try and go directly to the gate and ask to make an exception so that I can bring my luggage onboard since it was a hand luggage and the check in closed without any warnings or announcements. When I arrived to the gate, another Ryanair lady told me that exceptions can not be made since internal policies obligate you to check in extra pieces of hand luggage. I tried to told her what happened but I had to pay a fee of EUR 25,00 and was not able to take the baggage on board. I was forced to hand it in before entering the plane and that was the last time I saw it being placed into the airplane hold without any damage, being perfectly intact. When I arrived to Eindhoven my luggage was returned through the luggage belt, and it was completely torn apart. I went to the damaged luggage counter to ask how to proceed since Ryanair was responsible for destroying my luggage! The lady at the counter told me that I had to fill in a complaint and then go to the Ryanair website and ask for a refund. I did everything as needed, including going to the police bureau at the airport in Eindhoven. Ryanair told me that they could not do anything about what happened except refunding me with EUR 20,00. The reason why they could not do anything about it was that, since I could not hand in the receipt of my luggage - bought some years ago - they could not make sure how much the luggage was worth, why and how on earth should one keep the receipt of a luggage that was bought years before? Ryanair does not care about its customers, neither did they in the past, nor will they in the future!

The flight was rescheduled to 12 midnight, but it eventually only took off at around 1am the next day - a total of seven hours of delay. 2) Zero accountability. Ground staff were completely clueless as to any protocol in times of delay. Worse still, for the next ninety minutes or so there was no follow up action and all passengers were just stranded at the boarding gate. We were told to ""come check back every 30 min or so"" and there was no assurance of what would be done. 3) Shamelessly tried to shirk responsibility. We were told we could make claims via the EU261 flight regulation. However when I submitted my claim, the airline had the gall to say the flight was ""delayed due to air traffic controller restrictions, which was outside of our control"", which was totally opposite of the technical errors that the air crew had stated. 4) Poorest ever customer service. I followed up with Ryanair customer service staff who had zero professionalism. He was nonchalant throughout the correspondence. The incompetence of this staff member is highlighted in the fact he redirected me to the CAA UK site despite knowing my flight had departed from Spain, and that CAA does not serve cases where the flight departs from other EU member countries. Overall, I regret booking flights from a subpar company with service undeserving of any approval whatsoever. The rock-bottom standard is paralleled by its consistently plummeting stock price.

I rang Ryan Air a full 14 days before my outbound flight to let them know that I would not be able to travel after all due to family/personal reasons. As I had paid for their optional 'one trip travel insurance' I told them that I would be claiming my flight costs back via the insurance policy. To cut a long story short: I was told that Ryanair has no cancellation policy and that I would have to wait for at least 24 hours after my return journey and then phone Ryanair again to request a 'Did Not Show' confirmation letter. This will form step one in the insurance claim process. As my return flight was booked for 10th November I, therefore, phoned Ryanair 12th November. They told me they will email me the necessary 'Did Not Show' letter and that I can expect this in the next 8 working days. I said that this was a ridiculously long time to wait, particularly when the customer service agent said she could see that I hadn't used the ticket and would, therefore, be instructing the DNS letter to be processed immediately. When I asked what the procedure was once I had received the DNS letter she said she did not know but was sure that instructions would be included in the email. My issues are: I informed Ryanair 24th October that I would not be using my ticket but was told that I could not start to claim back my flight costs until at least 2 days after my return flight. This meant there would be an empty seat travelling to Vilnius 7th November and an empty seat travelling back to Luton on 10th November. As Ryanair confirmed there was no way of cancelling my ticket/seat then I must assume those seats were left empty! That sounds like very bad commercial practice - not something I would expect of a low cost/budget airline. Ryanair offers 'one trip travel insurance' at the time of booking and then cannot explain the procedure for making a claim against the insurance policy. They blame it on the fact that their insurers are a 'third party'! Check! The transaction was made between me and Ryanair and I expect Ryanair to be responsible. I now have to wait possibly another 10 days simply to start the claiming process - a process which I am still in the dark about. How much longer will this take?

The only strange thing about website vs application experience is that when purchasing priority boarding you can not buy 10 kg checked bag allowance on the website. On mobile you can do this. Another thing to watch is cost of this service. It changes, and the price can double, so if you need it, it is better to buy it early. At the airport check-in desk was not overcrowded. Boarding was fast and efficient, with usual nasty waiting when priority line had to be formed on the stairs and then lined up near the plane. But flying low cost you have to accept this. Onboard everything was ok. Seats are passably comfortable. I purchased hot meal and it was tasty. Toilet condition was good. Departures and arrivals both times on schedule. I was able to read all the bad reviews, but as I can see most of them are written by the people who didn't follow rules and been fined for that. For me the main difference between legacy carriers and low cost is that legacy bring you to your destination whatever happens (they put you on different flight or on competition company or re-route you). Low cost carriers just say sorry and do refund. This is where the real difference is.

It is my first and last time flying with them! I strongly, strongly advise you to never ever fly with them on principle alone! Their baggage rules and deadlines are ridiculous. As a whole I paid an extra $162 Euros for a flight that was only supposed to be $94 Euros. In Canadian, that is almost $300 extra dollars so naturally I'm upset. The worst thing about this company is the complete lack of customer service. The carry-on I took to Madrid is built in the dimensions to fit all cabin flights. The exact same carry-on I took from Madrid to Porto was all of a sudden too big to return to Madrid. I tried to explain this to the staff member and the first thing she says to me is, ""I'm just doing my job, it's not my fault they weren't doing their job over there."" Note that this is the exact same company and the inconsistency is frustrating. She asked me to come with her and check the size and in my opinion it fit and she disagreed. I asked to talk to the supervisor who approached me with hostility and attitude. She called me ""baby"" and when I kindly asked her not to call me that she called me it three more times before I refused to speak to her. I went to another Ryanair desk and asked another staff member who must have been instructed by her supervisor to treat me poorly because I simply asked her, ""Where is your customer service desk please?"" All of her body language including rolling her eyes was rude and I asked her why she was giving me attitude when I asked a reasonable question. All she told me was ""third floor"" and when I asked for more specific details she was reluctant and rude the whole time. I followed her instructions just to be told by security that the Ryanair customer service was outside which this staff member did not mention. Not wanting to miss my flight, I opted to pay whatever fee they needed and was met with minimum information, being rushed and two people talking to me at once. Once said I had to pay 25 Euros and the other said I had to pay 50 Euros which I ended up paying with no print out receipt which I had received on the Madrid side. This company can not assume that everyone knows exactly how everything works and they need to learn to treat people reasonably if they are incapable of kindness. On my first experience with Ryanair I interacted with a total of 8 very poor employees the worst of which was the supervisor from Porto who called me ""baby"" after kindly being asked several times not to do that.

Well, the low price of this flight naturally attracts you when you are booking your ticket, but if you know for different unreasonable reasons that you might have never heard before in your life they will charge you over 1000 euros and does not let you get into your flight, you might change your mind.

We were among the first people that went to the check-in desk and there, they told us that we should have done online check-in 3 minutes ago at the latest and now we have to pay 55 euros per person for them to do the check-in. So we paid this money, and again we were among the first people who were at the gate to go to the airplane. When they were checking our boarding pass, they said that there was a problem with one of our check-in luggage and we can not get into the plane! (Later they never informed us what was the problem.) When I tried to convince them that they have to wait for us to solve the problem, their crew rudely shouted at me! They told us to go to the Ryanair desk at the airport (SXF) and there they told us that this is not their responsibility and there is no one there to help us, and all we can do is writing a complaint letter! The only option they gave us, and they believed that we have to be thankful about that, was paying 100 euros per person and get new tickets for the day after, and since I was with my family and had no other reasonable choices, I had to pay more money and book the ticket.  After all, they destroyed our vacation, and we had a lot more additional costs for the hotel and all other expenses to spend the night in Berlin.

With a mentality that it’s similar to other airlines, I thought I could do the check-in on the spot. When I arrived at the desk, the staff told me that I had to do the check-in online and cannot do it any more now. Then I was told that I have to go to the ticketing office upstairs to pay 55 euro for the check-in and come back to him. He also told me, “You can jump the queue and come to me once you have paid.” Then I showed him my 6,9 kg hand luggage suitcase, then he told me, “You cannot bring this on board and you have to do check-in luggage. For this, you need to pay 25 euro.” Hearing this, I was very shocked. I told the staff, “This is furbo (cheating), if a person travels for the first time with this airline and does not know the regulations, he/she has to pay extra or even more than the actual ticket.” Having no choice, I went to the ticketing office. While waiting for the staff to do my check-in, a gentleman arrived breathlessly as he was running to the desk to see if the staff can help him as the departure time of his plane had changed but he did not get any notification. The staff coldly said, “No, the gate has already closed.” The gentleman asked, “Could you do anything?” The staff replied, “I’m sorry, I can do nothing.” After paying my 80 euro, I went downstairs to the same desk and to the same staff who asked me to go to pay. Then he printed out my ticket. My questions are that, “Isn’t he working at the same desk, doing the same procedures of checking in? Why can’t he print the ticket before I made the payment and can print it after I paid?” A thought crossed my mind that “This airline lives on fine and on taking advantage of those who have no or less knowledge?” There’s blame on my part for not knowing that I have to do online check-in earlier but there’s also the cunning/cheating part of Ryanair.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Rome,Seville,September 2019,2.0,2.0,,1.0,2.0,no,,1.0

It was obviously set to charge customers regardless and shows how underneath and conniving Ryanair really is. The staff at our gate entrance was very very rude and made us pay for our cabin bags at the time we felt most vulnerable to get onto the flight. ‘You either pay now, or you miss your flight’. Apparently ‘the rules had changed’ despite flying with the same luggage with the same airline to get to Rome (also not an issue with the same cabin bags on multiple flights).

Where my wife was sat there was dried blood around the seat. She also needed to use the bathroom, which was filthy and covered in urine. When she enquired as to a better option, the attendant locked the door of the dirty toilet and simply opened a previously locked bathroom.

Booking System of Ryanair: it is as shitty as you expect it to be from a low cost airline. The prices seem to appear low at first sight but in the end you end up with ruffly the same amount as with other airlines. They try to sell you so much shit you don't need. Like it was worth being in boarding group 1, going through a ""fast lane Check in""... In the end you just wait as long as everyone else because it doesn't make the whole boarding faster, but Ryanair sends you Emails saying ""better buy it, don't lose time at the airport, board hands free,..."" putting you under pressure to buy all the extras. Why would you need to book extra ""sitting together""? Despite the fact that you are able to spend 2 hours in a plane without sitting together and if needed kindly ask one of the other passengers to change seats. Ryanair's seat booking system could easily make you sit next to each other but it doesn't do it on purpose so you spend again extra 7€ or more just to sit to your beloved. All buttons on Ryanair's website which say something like ""add to card"" are highlighted but the ones which say ""skip"" are not just to make you feel you need to buy stuff. 2. The actual flight: In the airplane the whole tables are screwed to the seat so customers can't eat from them and the seats got no bags for your laptop etc. so Ryanair ""saves time"" during the cleanup for the next flight. Of course they always have some ""special offers"" in the air and they disturb you several times wanting you to buy parfumé or other stuff that you ""need right now"". 3. And what's about the luggage thing?! It always was a wired thing in every airline but Ryanair took it to another level. As it would matter if 2 kg too much on the luggage are taken out and put in your hand luggage, it's still on the same airplane?! Ryanair changed the policy of luggage in November 2018. So a normal hand luggage (55x40x20) that counts for every other airline is considered to be normal luggage for Ryanair now. And of course everyone who takes his old loved hand luggage now to the boarding gate is stopped by Ryanair and charged 25€ extra.

Long story short they charged my €55 to check in. I now know their charges on late check in but there was absolutely no empathy for my issue. No flexibility and couldn’t care less. It was about getting money from me. I had another occasion to contact their customer service team to get back an iPad that I left on their plane. Again absolutely useless in either their knowledge of how to help me and they didn’t care. Luckily I was able to get the iPad back due to the find my phone app. I will fly with them only (and only) because they are cheap. So I will use them the way they use their customers. I predict the unions will create a situation where Ryanair will end up having to charge the same as much better and reputable airlines like Aer Lingus (an absolute pleasure to fly with) and then Ryanair will not last.

We got the boarding pass while we were on holiday by kiwi.com and boarding pass says, if you need to carry 2 cabin bags you need to buy priority but one cabin bag is allowed and standard sizes are mentioned. In the checking desk, they check your bag says only small cabin bag is allowed which is much smaller than the standard size and ask you to pay 25 Euro per bag that is Euro 100 for my family. I should have easily got much better airline for that amount of extra money. So readers, do not fly Ryanair they will con you to your last penny to make money.

They’ll separate two companion travellers, despite them having booked their tickets together, as a means of forcing people to purchase reserved seats. 3) Finally, they employ or train the rudest staff (in my experience - and I have travelled widely), because they respond to complaints with an utter lack of empathy.

It didn’t bother me whether we did or not, so I didn’t bother with that, but couldn’t then check in until 48 hrs before the flight and had to print my boarding pass (eboarding pass not available). So, effectively, unless you are going somewhere with a printer, or for less than 48 hrs you had to book seats ahead, and therefore pay for them on the flight home! Then, as the tickets weren’t priority (?), we had to pay for our bags on the way back (5 x £25 = £125 + £39 for the seats added £164 onto our bill). On top of this, the staff talked to us like we were stupid. Another customer, who was having the same issue was furious, and the staff were equally rude to him. To top it all off, the flight was delayed by half an hour without a mention or apology, the air hostess told us we had to give her our rubbish half an hour before landing or take it home, as she wanted to get home too! And then the luggage handlers broke one of our cases after paying for the privilege of putting it in the hold against my will.

We made it through security and once to the gate things were hectic again. The Ryanair attendants were treating a couple from India quite terribly, accusing the woman of having a fake visa.

Fair enough to charge us a bit but not that much. Then we were given our seat numbers and surprise surprise we weren't seated together even though the plane was half empty. We then proceeded on the plane to all swap seats so people were sat next to each other which because of all the empty seats was no problem.

When we get there we get told that it's actually gate 91 (other side of the airport) and the lady says ""there's only 2 minutes left, you won't make it"". We ask whether she can make a call to advise we are on our way and this obviously was declined. So we start running again, with backpacks and hold luggages, to get to the right gate. This was very difficult to find and the airport staff we asked weren't that helpful. As expected we don't make it on time.

Technically they charge for choosing your seat, but again, my opinion is that it seems they make an effort to spread families around the plane unless you pay for the seating option. Their check-in process is a scam. You will receive an email 3 days before travel telling you to check in online or you will be charged 55 pounds. Okay, fair enough because they have warned you with a personal email, until you try to check in. After you enter all your passport and personal information for you and your party and go through all that hassle and get to the end of the check-in process, they'll tell you that you have to pay a fee to check in prior to 48 hours before departure. If you forget (like I did) and remember to do so once you arrive at the airport 1 hour and 59 minutes before your flight (like I did) and try to check in online, it will cost you 55 pounds per ticket.  Here's the process: a) Wait in the queue at check in. The check in person informs you that you owe a fee. She fills out the a form (by hand) that you have to take to customer service. Wait in the queue at customer service. Pay your fee (which for us doubled the cost of our tickets). They fill out another form by hand (including credit card information by hand) and stamp it. You have to take this new form back to check in. Wait for a second time in the check in queue. You hand her this second form and she finally issues the boarding passes. Run to security because although you arrived 1 hour and 59 minutes early, most of that time has now been spent in 3 queues just to get a boarding pass. Again, read the fine print and understand what you are in fo. I recognize my own failings working with Ryanair, but it really seems like their process is designed to cause a certain number of passengers to fail at their game and when you fail, you pay so dearly.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Manchester,Barcelona,April 2019,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,no,,

When the safety demonstration was being performed it came across that the crew simply could not be bothered with their jobs and just wanted to be at home. After takeoff the crew continued to look fed up and put no effort into providing a decent onboard service for customers. When pushing the trolley through the aircraft they seemed to show the most attention to those customers who were sat on the left hand side of the plane. The announcements made by the crew were inaudible, partly due to an accent issue and partly due to the poor PA system fitted to this aircraft. The only time I saw the crew look happy was upon landing in Edinburgh when they were seeing us off the flight.

The employee was basically appalled that we had extra weight and again sent us to the other counter to pay for being overweight (205 extra euros!). We already knew before coming to the airport that we were going to have to pay a fee for the extra weight so again we were met with unprompted disrespect; we even told this employee that we understood we had to pay more and we’re okay with that but again his reaction was demeaning and unwarranted. We did not talk back nor initiate any disrespectful dialogue and hence why I am prompted to write this review.

The weather was terrible (heavy snowstorm) and a lot of flights were either cancelled or rerouted. However what happened with Ryanair was unprecedented. Although all passengers from other airline companies were brought to their hotels by around 2.30 in the morning, passengers from 3 Ryanair flights were moved out of the airport at around 7.00 in the morning. In the beginning, the company did not officially cancel the flights so we were not allowed to take our luggage. Afterwards, we were not properly informed whether we should change our tickets (Ryanair was not going to send an aircraft the next day, so passengers would have to wait 2 or 3 days at least to fly to their destinations). ask for a refund or wait to catch a flight the next day. In addition, the online application did not work, so we had to form endless queues for any option we wanted to follow. In general, the situation was chaotic. The company is totally disorganised and left 3 or 4 employees (for whom there is absolutely no complaint, they were trying to do their best) to deal with more than 400-500 passengers (from 3 flights) without having the proper instructions from their headquarters. During the whole night that we stayed in the airport, I was under the impression that the company policy was to make us book our own hotels and therefore save the company some cash. In that respect, Ryanair vouchers are half the price compared to the other companies and they are being announced in a -kind of- secret way!!! The next day the weather was sunny so Ryanair started accommodating the flights of that day, so that the company would not have to deal with more delays, refunds etc. This resulted in the passengers of the already delayed flights being stranded at the airport for 2-3 days without any information (their flights were not even shown in the ""departures"" table). The situation was ""resolved"" when incredibly angry customers demanded to catch the next Ryanair aircraft available. After a lot of fights with the personnel and the person in charge of the airline (police presence was deemed necessary) I believe we finally boarded a plane with a different original destination. Flight was acceptable, although Ryanair did not even consider offering a bottle of water to the passengers. Do yourselves a favour, give some extra money and travel with a different company.

The queue for priority boarding was 100 people long when I joined the queue and even longer behind me after 30 minutes. The non - priority queue? 4 people when I joined the queue and about 20 or so when boarding started. So you pay for priority to carry your case on board? Don't bother - the non priority queue had cases just like mine. But the non priority queue on the other side of the barrier will board after the priority queue? Are you kidding? the non priority queue got on the same bus at the same time as the priority queue and a lot quicker as well as there were so few of them. Nobody supervised the gate - the automatic door opened and we all got onto the bus together. The gate number was 90. On board, it was fine - I had a window seat on both journeys (despite not paying for a seat reservation) and was happy counting the revenue stream as the bags were loaded into the aircraft hold. I counted several thousand pounds worth of revenue for Ryanair on the assumption that the bags were priced at £25 each. Ryanair are very clever in convincing the flying public to pay for priority when there is no priority - and even more clever in marketing the product so that the majority of your passengers actually take the option. I suggest that as the public catch on to this cunning revenue maximising plan you will have to change the rules again as ""priority"" boarding is probably breaking some trade description act and the public aren't stupid. However, despite this little rant, don't forget that Ryanair does offer exceptionally low prices and if it wasn't for them and other similar low cost carriers we'd still be paying extortionate prices to the likes of BA and Aer Lingus and moaning about their high fares and poor service levels.

We were boarded for our flight and then left standing on a ramp in Malaga airport for 30 minutes while they cleaned the aircraft. The seats are uncomfortable and the service is lacking.

Schoenefeld Airport was quieter than I had seen it, but the usual crush at the inadequately-designed followed, although boarding staff kept good control of the boarding process.

This caused a delay on departure, and the Captain apologised for the heat in the cabin, which was caused by a ""lack of air conditioning power units"" at the airport, but I could see when we were departing the aircraft needed an air start unit, so obviously there was an issue with the aircraft's ground power.

When we arrived in London at late night we had to wait almost 30 minutes to get out of the plane, since no bus was available to pick us up. After other 30 minutes queuing at passport control, we had to wait almost one hour for the luggage before we were informed that it could take few hours to be delivered, since there were no worker available (apparently they were on holidays or on strike). There were many passengers from other flights in the same condition. There was only a Ryanair representative, clearly overwhelmed and unable to deal with the situation. He finally provided us with a number to call the day after to have more information about our luggage. He did not tell us to file any report nor he provided us with any written information. When I left the airport it was 3am and no trace of my bag. The day after I tried to call that number maybe 20-30 times and none never picked up the phone. I had several chats with Ryanair representatives on the Ryanair website and I was just told to call the same number which doesn’t work or where nobody picks up the calls. I was told further by Ryanair representatives on the chat that when I call that number they will be able to fill with me a missing luggage report, because without it nobody can do anything. As I said before, the Ryanair representative at the airport did not mention that we had to file such a report, but he just provided us with the mentioned number to call. I have also filed several reports and complaints via Ryanair website by using different forms, nobody came back to me with any response. If I wanted to file a query with Ryanair Baggage Claim Form, I could not do it, without the missing luggage report number. Ryanair didn’t provide any different number where I could speak to someone who could effectively provide for help.

The only issue I've had during the boarding process was because of Bratislava airport staff but that has nothing to do with Ryanair. I have one complaint but I do understand it. Checking in we got our seats seperated, but with the ticket price Ryanair sells, it's still cheap even after buying Selected seats. The food on board was cold, but when I asked the crew to heat it some more they kindly offered to do so. After landing the process was quick, but due to some issues at Stansted (which I learned happens often) we waited over an hour for our luggage. Having arrived soon in the morning and not having had any coach/train reservation for a specific time, this wasn't an issue for me. On my way back I would have things to complain about, but I'm not sure how much of it is Ryanair's fault.

This meant I could carry a 10kg bag with a small bag. Arrived at the airport to drop my suitcase but was told I had to pay £50 because I didn't have this on my ticket.

Making a total of £100 pounds excluding the cost of my original ticket which was £98. While queuing pay for the cost of my laugage, I met several families who had exactly thesame problem as myself.

Now if I had known that this flight would have cost me almost £200, I certainly would have flown with British Airways without any doubt. Well, you learn every day.

My girlfriend and I checked in 3 days in advance and we were not given seats next to each other, even though the tickets were ordered at the same time and we could *see* that the seats next to each of us were available. Ryanair then prompted us ""Want to sit together?"" We could upgrade. Basically they tried to charge us extra money to get the service that you get included in every other flight. Obviously we didn't do that, and when we got on the flight it was mostly empty and everyone could sit wherever they wanted. Ryanair wasn't doing this splitting the seating to 'improve seating algorithm' or 'allow larger groups'- they were doing it solely to milk another couple bucks out of us from our ticket. Same thing in a different vein for every other aspect of the trip from boarding to arriving - boarding groups, luggage, etc. There must have been a dozen different upgrades you could purchase to bring the quality of their ticket up to the standard quality of every other existing airline. Obviously every airline does this to some extent, but the breaking up seating was the one that really got to me. Their carry-on luggage options were just as bad on paper, though the actual flight attendants were very relaxed about what could and couldn't be brought on a flight. That might depend on the people though- on paper, you would struggle to bring anything onto this flight for free as a carry-on. Caused a lot of needless anxiety as we were preparing to leave our backpacks worked for 99% of other airlines, but would they cost us $80 to bring through Ryanair? If they aren't going to enforce the luggage stuff they should relax it on paper so it doesn't cause travelers so much stress. On top of that, every other part of the trip was irritating in every way. Boarding process started ~30 minutes late for both of our flights. They accidentally left us stuck in a hot and crowded staircase for half an hour waiting for a bus. At some point during the flight they tried to sell us scratch-off lottery tickets for additional flights, which was annoying and loud and also just plain *weird*. Despite how late we always boarded, the flight was never late. The pilots cut down the flight by a lot of time. Very noticeable in landing, I've dropped my phone with more grace than some of these landings. I guess this is technically a plus but feeling like your pilot is rushing is never a good feeling on a flight for me. In summary, it was a miserable experience all around.

Security did not seem unduly concerned. Far from being last in the queue unfortunately I was directed to a very slow moving parallel screening queue for Xrays etc - which did indeed leave me one of the last downstairs to the gate, where I was witness to a queue of some 20 people already arguing with the gate staff who told them they were ""late"" and could not board. The situation was made more ridiculous as there was a half-empty bus waiting outside, for at least 10 minutes while the team of 2 on the desk refused to let more people past. Eventually this bus departed, only for another one to turn up - again we were not allowed to board this by the gate staff. Someone else turned up and we were effectively told tough, go and re-book as they would not let us through. As a result families were split as the block was seemingly arbitrarily applied from one passenger to the next - which was appalling, moreover he had medication for his wife and they still would not let the guy through nor make any attempt to get these to him. Clearly there was no communication between security and the gate which was hugely frustrating, security was understaffed as they could not physically process the volume of passengers in the timeframe (if I were more suspicious I would think there may be some 'special arrangement' to engineer this). Moreover this happens regularly - one of the gate staff told us *45* people were denied boarding under similar circumstances the day before and a quick twitter search showed this happened at least once more this same week.

This tag is so made up you can just rip it off and try your luck getting your hand bag into the cabin. If you are traveling with your SO or a child, expect to pay just to sit together because it will purposely ""randomly"" allocate you as far as possible. Inside the cabin, you'll find the worst flight attendants the aeronautic industry has to offer.

However, I was charged an extra total of 80 euros for both bookings (40 euros for each booking - 20 euros for each flight), although the old and new flight prices were exactly the same at the time of the change to the booking! Moreover, the aforementioned change happened in the 24 hours grace period (actually it was done less than 2-3 hours after the original booking). According to Ryanair's website and the 24 hour grace period (for this kind of changes) the dates change should have been at no cost (as the price of the flights at that time was exactly the same). I initially tried to address the situation with Ryanair's Live Chat customer assistance. But not only were they not helpful at all or even willing to try and check the reason for what happened, but they were also abrupt and rude.

Unfortunately, I have been a regular customer of the airline the last couple of years and I thought that if I address this matter through their website and the complaint forms (which by the way, good luck finding the proper link and form to submit one), that maybe they will be honest and upfront about the unfair charge and sort it out as soon as possible. I even sent them printscreens from the original flight prices (taken at the time of the booking and of course the new booking charges). However, the only reply I got back from Ryanair's customer service was a repeated standard reply prewritten form saying that the prices on the website are live and they may change at anytime (no one argued against that - however they don't even mention the fact that the prices were exactly the same) and that there can be a fee for changing the dates (no mention of the 24hour grace period). I confronted them replying to all these nonsense and they sent me the same reply, only to finally add the fact that once they receive a payment they cannot provide any refunds for any mistakes concerning the payment received (Great business policy, right?).

That Ryanair is low fare is well known and so I did expect not to have much space on the plane and that I was able to take one bag into the cabin if lucky. When I was already sitting on the plane from Bratislava to Stansted I received my e-mail that my flight from Stansted to Aalborg was canceled and I could not get off the plane to Stansted because it was too late. In Stansted, I was told that I have to wait 26 hours for a next flight and I had a right to have a refund and at least a hotel room where to stay till the next day. After waiting for 7 hours at the customer service I was told to wait for extra 2 hours just so they will check if there is any hotel room available. After another 3 hours they told me at the customer service that they don't know anything about a hotel room and that they will give me a standby ticket to Billund and I can try to catch it, because in that time I had less than an hour and there have been more standby tickets and they took just limited amount of them. It was hell, but after problems at the airport check-in and running for life (and plane) I got there. I arrived in Billund at late night and I had to travel to Aalborg by buses until the morning. I asked for refunds and they told me that I will receive them within 10 working days. That was in September 2017. I did not receive anything and I tried to contact them multiple times but either I was ignored completely or they just wrote me that they forwarded my e-mails and complains to different departments. In December 2017 I finally was able to contact them and account department of Ryanair wrote me that I will have my refunds on my account within 28 days. 28 working days passed and I haven't seen a penny. Honestly, I would not recommend using this airline no matter what. If you have a chance to use a different airline or transport please do.

The agent acknowledged they had my passport. However they would not bring it back to me. I had to go get it myself. The gate being the furthest away meant a 20 min run both way. In short there was no way I could exit security and return to the gate on time to catch my flight. I asked them if they could wait for me for a few extra minutes rather than offloading my bags. Their answer was no, and the gate will be closing soon too. Any airline who respect their passengers would have had the passport rushed to the gate on time by one of their staff.

Well, the flight was delayed 3 hrs exactly, we didn’t board until 3 hrs later, but it could have landed less than 3 hrs later, which I wouldn’t know, because I didn’t check the exact time I landed, it could be about 2hr 50min later than expected in Sofia. Ryanair also said, any flights that are delayed more than 1.5hr, customers are entitled to claim back expenses during the wait at the airport, providing receipts are provided. At the same time, they closed my case. I took this as a complaint, I asked for the exact time it landed in Sofia; asked for the reason of the delay; explained due to the delay, I lost a night at the hostel, and had to explain to them that I had to sleep at the airport; and why no one informed us there would be spending expenses for delays over 1.5hr?  When I got a reply from Ryanair, the staff was not even answering any of my questions, he just repeated the same thing as the first person said, told me to submit any receipts. Also that the flight was delayed for less than 3 hrs, so I was entitled to the 3hr+ claim. I tried again, explaining this further, but once again, it was no use. They were not doing anything about it. I just wanted to warn anyone flying around Europe, if there’re any delays, make sure you check the time, and make a record of it if possible. You can always get it from the website afterwards and save a record for it, if you need any claims. If it’s delayed for less than 3 hrs, check the airline’s policy and see what you’re entitled to. Because obviously they would not just tell you the freebies you could be entitled to, to save their cost! Anyway, Ryanair service is bad, all the emails I had with them back and forth, they were terrible. A different staff reply to my email every time, just repeating the same things over and over again, and not answering to my questions. Up until now, I still have no idea what caused the delay, or the exact time the flight landed.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Glasgow,Sofia,July 2017,2.0,3.0,,2.0,4.0,yes,,

Later still, the cancellation farrago threw the whole holiday into doubt until Ryanair was forced to publish the lists of flights affected and we learned that our flights were still on. Then the day before we flew we received an email warning of a ban on carrying alcohol into the cabin and telling us what would happen to any alcohol bought in the ""duty-free"" shops. This did not affect us directly as we never buy any ""duty-free"" but we did wonder whether the flight was going to be full of hen and stag parties. By then, any faith we might have had in Ryanair was pretty well dispelled and we had no high hopes of the flights themselves. In the event everything went fairly smoothly. Boarding for the outward flight was handled efficiently by a single agent while the cabin crew were both pleasant and hardworking. The cabin manager, in particular, carried out her duties very responsibly (for example, not starting the safety demonstration until she was sure that she had the attention of practically everyone on board) but with good humour. There was some changing of seats before we departed, but we were only a few minutes late rolling back. We arrived early (cue the awful triumphal blast) after an uneventful journey. For the return flight, boarding was slightly delayed though it did not impact upon our actual departure time. The cabin crew again worked hard but it was difficult to hear any of their announcements, due to the speed with which they were made plus the conversation level within the cabin. The actual flight was equally uneventful and we arrived marginally early, so we had the trumpet blast again, which this time was greeted by ironic cheers. After all the various alarms beforehand, therefore, we made it there and back without any real bother, but my wife and I have still decided that we will do our best to avoid Ryanair in the future. How can you trust a company that changes the rules after you have booked, yet denies it has done so, or cancels flights on a whim and tries to wriggle out of any of the consequences? My overall rating here therefore balances out the pluses of the actual flights against the minuses of the doubts and uncertainties beforehand.",Boeing 737-800,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Manchester,Palma,October 2017,2.0,4.0,,4.0,3.0,no,,

The booking system is quite obviously setup to seat people as far apart as possible so the priority seating charge can be applied to sit together, this method leaves you with a feeling of being ripped off, a fact born out in most reviews we read. I personally would prefer the £3 to be automatically applied to the fare with an option to be randomly seated for £3 less, this would leave you feeling you had a bargain instead and cut down complaints and as most people prefer to travel together the airline would probably make more from it and everyone would be happy. We recieved 3 reminder emails from ryanair prompting us to check in online and avoid the airport checkin charge which was good. We were pleasantly surprised by the flights, both journeys were on time and even landed ahead of schedule. The planes were clean and looked new and the staff were proffessional and curtious.

Rather a dramatic difference, but then I suppose that is how they rinse you of more money! I'd come to terms with not taking a suitcase for a whopping £80 return, so I had squashed my stuff into a little hand suitcase and was happy with the fact you had no waiting time at the other end for your case. Unfortunately, as we got to the gate to board the plane, I was told my little case was to go into the hold for free as there were now more than 90 passengers with hand luggage! But it didn't get whisked off by a memeber of staff, oh no, I had to carry it down the steps, and put the thing on the suitcase truck myself! Once aboard the plane and once we realised that our seats were at the other end of the plane, I sat down in my seat and crossed my fingers for a good flight out in between all the stag and hen dos shouting to one another as none of them were sat next to each other either! Makes sense that doesn't it! So we set off on time and the cabin crew have to ask 4 times for everyone to shut up while they carry out the safety demonstration. Four times they got ignored!

This was more than both our tickets combined. It was 6:30 in the morning, and we were the only ones there. I couldn't believe it.

If this airline wants to save money by limiting staff and doing things online, I support that - but I should have still been able to check in myself then at that time - to cut off the online checkin 2 hours before and charge a ridiculous fee at that time is just shady, wrong and I felt so angry. They already have additional costs for everything - we had paid to check our bags, and we had paid extra for 'priority' seating so our seats were already reserved - so why would we check in??? So angry and disappointed. The worst part is, this airline clearly does not care about what their customers think, and that makes the customer totally powerless to ensure that the service they're receiving is fair, and this case it's not.

I really despise the Ryanair’s boardnig procedure – the gate opens before even the airplane finishes its previous rotation.

The flight was smooth and everything went without delay. The thing that made me uncomfortable onboard was the air in the cabin – it smelled as if it was really polluted which made me difficult to breathe. What is more, it seemed like the cabin crew‘s only duty was to sell food/scratchcards/duty free products to the ‘customers‘.

If you play by the rules, and do as they say you get a cheap flight that's usually comfortable and on time. Using Stansted for this, the gate was far away from the terminal which is fine. Having bought priority boarding, I was one of the first to board but somehow that doesn't matter, just be at the front of the regular queue and you'll save a few quid in the process. Only 90 carry on's can be placed in the overhead locker so I asked for mine to be placed in the hold, gate staff are more often than not happy to assist in that matter when they are asked. Bag tag goes on and I left my suitcase with a baggage handler. Onboard the aircraft was with the old Ryanair cabin on one of their oldest Boeing 737-800 although, she didn't look it. The majority of the Ryanair fleet have the older, more padded seats in a 189Y configuration so good if you're a little larger, like myself. The newer in the fleet with the Boeing Sky Interior have the lighter-weight seating which has far less padding but more legspace although I cannot vouch for that. The seat was comfortable and legspace was okay although another inch would of been beneficial for all 6"" of me. Crew attentive as always passing through the cabin twice on this three hour flight providing a refreshments service which I find to be overpriced so buy before hand in the airport where you'll save money. Crew also passed through the cabin with some perfumes, electronic items and the famous Ryanair scratchcard. Onboard was rather warm but the flight was near enough full so that's to be expected. A comfortable crossing. A smooth landing into Sofia and we parked on a remote stand. Bussed to the terminal on a sweltering old bus into Terminal 2, the better of the two terminals. Ryanair being one of the few low cost carriers to use Terminal 2. Passport control was smooth with border police just visually checking my passport while there was a short delay with getting my bag on the carousel. Returning was a similar affair. The gate staff at Sofia look for oversize bags at the gate so please be warned in carrying oversized bags not to the restrictions. They were also checking for oversized second carry on bags too. I asked for my suitcase to be placed in the hold which the obliged. The flight was delayed 40 minutes due to a delay with the inbound aircraft; something that does happen from time to time with the last flights of the day with Ryanair. I slept for most of the flight home onboard a full flight. Air-conditioning was on although it was rather warm onboard and I slept comfortably for such a small space. A quick left hand turn onto short finals ensured a smooth landing into London Stansted. Parked on a remote stand again and was bussed on an old London bendy bus to the terminal where my bag was waiting on the carousel. If you do as your told and play by the rules, you will get a cheap flight. Book ahead in advance and it will be cheap too.

We have flown with the best, Etihad, Cathay, Singapore Airlines, Emirates etc. We have also flown with many budget airlines around the world. We can now say we have flown with what must be, the worst airline on earth. We were in the middle of a cruise with no internet. We docked at Ibiza and went for a coffee. Whilst there we got internet access and received an email from Ryanair saying if we didn't check in, we could be charged $50 Euro each. To our disbelif, we tried to check in online but at the final stage, we were kicked out of the website. We tried several times. At that time there was a global virus effecting everywhere and our search engine Google was not allowing us to access many websites. We were in the Ryanair website but could not complete the check-in. We eventually gave up and decided to try later. Our next stop was Palma where we departed the ship. As we did not have internet access, we decided to get to the airport early so we could hopefully complete check-in well before the 2 hour window Ryanair gives. We arrived at Palma airport 2 hours and 40 minutes before our flight. We waiting in the check-in queue for around 25 minutes. When we finally were called we explained to the check-in lady that we could not check-in as their website wold not let us complete the checkin the day before. She then went out of her way to try and check us in on our mobile phone. She gave us the thumbs up, but then she must have had the same problem. She tried again but could not check us in on our phone. With 8 minutes before the the 2 hour window, she gave up and said sorry you have 8 minutes good luck. We tried but could not check in on time. Then we went back to the check-in counter and the lady gave us a docket to go to the service counter to pay the $100 Euro ($50 x 2). We walked to the service counter and stood in line for another 15 minutes. We paid $100 Euro because we had no option. When we originally booked this flight, we had other options and wow didn't we regret flying this airline.

When you view the seat photo, the yellow is the head rest of the seat in front. This will show how tight the seats are. The plane looked dirty. As we sat down we heard a lady with a British accent discuss the lack of baggage storage. She had a small bag. The Ryanair stewardess said ""bad luck, take your seat"". The lady passenger yelled ""Typical Ryanair"" The photos attached show the condition of the plane. The seating stunk, worn leather.

There's a £5 charge anyway, but that's okay. Except that Ryanair won't allow you to upgrade the next flight to match to price of your existing one, forcing you to undercut your ticket price and lose money. Ryanair don't refund this money back to you, won't allow you to use this money as credit on other flights or services and don't allow you to add options to your new flight, like additional baggage, ect. The customer service advisers I spoke to were awful, none of them made any suggestions or offered help, but continually spammed the same response about terms and conditions over and over. So I find that I can fly to Ireland without a Passport anyway, since I'm flying from the UK. I can use my driving license. Except you can't with Ryanair. You can with other airlines, but not Ryanair. So pretty much in every way, Ryanair have made this mistake as costly for me as possible.

I asked for the list and was astonished to find the prices expressed in euros. When I questioned this, the steward told me that this was because Ryanair was an Irish airline. When I asked what the conversion rate to sterling was, I was told it was roughly the same. Crews are now equipped with handheld calculators. I was 'allowed' to pay in sterling, but, when I asked what the exchange rate was, was simply told 'Ryanair's own'. So, to sum up: lack of transparent/any visible pricing, exorbitant on-board prices - and not even a half-melted ice cube in sight! Why can't the CAA set some basic standards and sort Ryanair out once and for all? We know the fares are cheap, but that shouldn't be an excuse for trying to bamboozle people.

They add charges for everything: printing your ticket, baggage check-in, meals, drinks, choosing your seat etc. Traveling around I did not have access to a printer. At the airport they charged me 15 Euro just to print the boarding pass, which I had to do myself. So that is charging me 15 Euro for me to touch their screen a few times and use a small piece of their paper? This, and everything else, is pure extortion. Even on the flight you are constantly harassed to buy things. There is no doubt that you are seen as a money-making opportunity and not as a person or valued client. The crew are friendly, but not the ground staff and their system is cumbersome and disorganised. I vow never to fly Ryanair again.

Departure was delayed by half an hour for air traffic control purposes but, once airborne everything went very smoothly and I managed to catch up with some sleep on the way. Cabin crew were friendly, informative and appeared to meet all the needs expected of them by passengers.

I had never flown with Ryanair before, and was not expecting much with it being a low-cost airline. Entering the terminal (Manchester T3) we were annoyed to see that Ryanair checks in all their flights at the same counters, and that there was a huge queue, stretching all the way to the cafés nearby. We arrived two hours before the flight and the check in queue took over an hour and obviously we were worried about missing our flight. After getting through check in and security we were running to catch the flight even after being sent to the front of the line in security, thankfully we made it. Upon entering the aircraft (B737-800) I was shocked at how crammed the plane was with seats, the legroom was barely big enough to get to the seat (middle) in the first place, but for a 2 hour flight I could manage. After departure we were handed a magazine with a menu inside. The menu was basic and quite overpriced, but I was hungry so I bought a buttered croissant and a tea (same on the way back) for €3. The flight attendants were kind, attentive and efficient and I received my food very quickly. The food was tasty and the croissant had been warmed. There was a little turbulence on the way, and my tea sloshed a little on me, and the flight attendant quickly helped me clean it up with a smile.

I'm happy with Ryanair's budget approach, but over many years of using their flights there's been a consistent changing of goal posts that inevitably disadvantages the customer. These do not seem to be writ large all over their website. My latest encounter involved printing boarding passes. I do both the mobile and the printed- belt n braces kind of approach. I was printing the passes from saved pdf files which displayed all images and the barcode perfectly. The boarding passes printed beautifully except for the barcodes. I altered every possible parameter on the printer, even printing as a super-fine image, with the same outcome ie perfect adverts, lovely table for the barcode info, crisp text, but the barcode a grayed-out blur or totally absent. I went online to their 'chat' - 'well i don't know change your printer' : I phoned customer service - 'use a different browser' - nobody else boarding that flight has had this problem so it's your fault'. Being an OCD sort I actually scrutinised the pretty-looking boarding pass I printed. Unlike earlier iterations, the barcode is now a smaller element of a foldable page stacked with big, colourful adverts. Many users may glance at this and not notice that the barcode is wonky or absent. Most customers will now, I guess, be using the mobile app. Which means that it looks like Ryanair have spotted a niche market represented by the digital divide - ie, if you aren't technically aware, and don't own a smartphone, you'll get 'fined' at check-in. Be interesting to see if any other customers have also experienced this. It interests me that in neither of my encounters with customer advice did the operative advise me to use the mobile app instead - which is the logical answer. In both encounters it was the usual Ryanair indifference plus assigning blame to 'stupid customers'.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,LPL,FNI,August 2016,3.0,3.0,,1.0,3.0,no,,

I have flown on this route about 6 times this year and have consistently been very satisfied with Ryanair. There are 3 other budget airlines which I could choose but Ryanair's fares are always the cheapest. They allow a cabin bag plus another small bag (e.g. laptop), which is generous for a budget airline. They boast about a 90% on time arrival (within an hour), and given my experiences I can believe it. I have been delayed once and that was because all flights were grounded due to weather. The staff are fine, friendly enough. Boarding can be a bit chaotic, and I would recommend paying the small fee for priority boarding (note that this does sell out, so do it at time of booking rather than a later add-on). Personally I don't care about in-flight entertainment, magazines, or drink services, so I won't make any judgement based on those (which is good, because they are either non-existent, or average at best). If you want a good trip here is what to bear in mind. Have expectations that match the price - this is a budget airline that tries to deliver best price by having no-frills. Read the rules and stick to them. Cabin bag dimensions are a bit smaller than usual which can catch you out. Only 20cm width as opposed to normal 25cm. Would have caught me out once but fortunately they didn't check bags at the gate. Be sure to check in online prior to arriving at the airport. They do not have check in desks, and if you haven't checked in you are setting yourself up for a hefty penalty. Only the first 90 bags will be boarded, the rest will be put into the hold free of charge. This means that if you insist on carrying your bag, you will have to queue up at the gate to make sure you are one of the earlier passengers to board. If you sit down and wait, go for a coffee or whatever, and then board later, you are not taking your bag on board. The only thing I wish they would change is to remove the bright yellow colour scheme from the cabin. Maybe it's branding, but it just lends a tackiness to the whole experience that seems unnecessary. I am sure they could adjust their brand to something slightly more tasteful. Overall I have to give them top marks. I am not sure they are the best choice for families with small children, but if you're a single traveller or a non-fussy couple/group, and you want to get from A to B cheaply, you won't beat them (on this route, at least).",Boeing 737-800,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,PRG,STN,June 2016,4.0,4.0,,4.0,5.0,yes,,

Check-in at Dublin was chaotic. We had no way to print our boarding passes and they were not downloadable. Not knowing there was a place to print them at the airport, we were reprimanded by the attendant at the bag drop but she printed them for us anyway. The boarding on both flights was somewhat chaotic. Again, we didn't bother to pay for priority boarding (why bother); but one of the flights didn't even have a plane at the gate, and we were herded like sheep into waiting buses which drove out on the tarmac to a waiting plane. Both flights were boarded out on the tarmac, climbing stairs to the plane. The FA's were all friendly enough but the head FA's making the announcements were difficult to understand (they weren't Irish). The flight from London Gatwick was delayed but no fault of the airline; it was due to heavy air traffic (and they only have one runway for both incoming and outgoing flights).

In addition, it is pleasing to see that Ryanair have begun using satellite 2 in Stansted for some of their flights, which offers a far more relaxed boarding experience, along with much more space and seating compared to satellite 3 (which is the main gate area from which Ryanair flights operate). Ryanair should definitely consider making more use of this facility, as it is very underused and often empty for long periods of the day.

Next, we were waiting for airport clearance, so about one hour later we were finally in the air. While in the air I asked Ryanair personnel what can I do about my connection because we will arrive late. All they could do is tell me it is not their fault we will be late and they cannot call the other airline to announce that we are running late. They did not care what would happen to us. They also told me to go to their Ryanair office in the airport to sees if they can help. When we arrived at the airport we found out Ryanair does not have an office in the Copenhagen airport so we were left in the airport with no help.

Booked the return flight separately as paying in euros saved money, even using my credit card. Had problems trying to check in online as our computer does not seem to like the new Ryanair website and in the end could only do so via the old so-called Legacy website, only to discover that airport security and boarding gates struggle to read the boarding codes. Outward flight was fine and everyone seemed to get their hand luggage on board despite the flight being full. The return journey was less satisfactory. It was delayed by an hour with no explanation or apology given. Boarding at Malaga was in 3 groups: priority first, then rows 22 - 33, then everyone else. We could see that it made sense to board the back rows first when using an airbridge, but some prior warning would have been helpful as the existence of the display notices indicates that it is Ryanair policy. Then as the rest of us were boarded, the boarding agents immediately began to tag our cabin baggage for free hold storage without any warning, which necessitated extracting items wanted on board as we waited beyond the gate. It seemed that there must have been a pre-determined number of passengers to be selected for hand luggage removal as those at the back of the queue were allowed to keep their bags. In fact, as there was a large school party on board with minimal hand luggage, there would have been plenty of room for everyone's bags. We couldn't help feeling unfairly treated as we were near the front in the original queue, but relegated towards the rear and then selected for baggage extraction as well. The flight itself was ok, though we do find Ryanair seats rather numbing after a couple of hours. Those who ordered food, however, were very discontented as it took so long to appear - some did not get theirs till the descent into Liverpool had already begun.",Boeing 737-800,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,LPL,AGP,June 2016,3.0,3.0,,4.0,4.0,yes,,

We didn't have anything to eat or drink as it was a short flight but we did buy our coach tickets from the FA and saved a few pounds. All staff encountered throughout were very friendly and helpful.

When the bus came and we are about to board priority staff again stopped me and asked me again, ""are you in priority?"" I did have priority boarding but not on the plane, but only on the bus that transported us to board the plane. So when boarding the plane, we still boarded as usual in a long queue. The seat onboard is normal and I was sitting in the front row near an aisle, which was really annoying as the corridor was so small and people kept going to the toilet located just in front of my seat, and therefore, I could not enjoy the ""long leg room"" as the space is just too small.

I fly this route several times a month and usually default to Aer Lingus as they can be cheaper if planned and booked in advance. This time fares on both airlines were exorbitant thanks to St Patrick's Day and the Cheltenham Festival and Ryanair came out cheaper. Brand new 737 with new interior and the very pleasant staff resplendent in their new uniforms. After a very stressful journey to the airport it was lovely to be greeted by such friendly staff, relaxing interior, comfortable seat (I had paid for exit seat for extra leg room so can't comment on the regular seats) and lovely relaxing music. It all felt surreal because our go-to response to anything Ryanair has usually always been negative but this looks like it's set to change. A few years ago, when I had taken my first Ryanair flight in many years I actually laughed at the state of the garish interior but not any more. Why ever did Ryanair not make these changes years ago, I imagine they are going to elicit quite the competitive response from competitors and not just from the no-frills market either. One comment I would always have to make about Ryanair is that although they can be categorised as 'no frills', the same can't be said about being a 'low fares' airline as some of the fares, particularly on this busy route can sometimes resemble long-haul fares.

Well apart from the huge queue that most people with limited diablilities could never stand in to go to bag drop. Flight called, we were taken to board the plane. Wait theres a massive problem, theres 6 people who have disabilities and need the abulift, but we were told Ryanair would only take 4! It seemed 2 others hadn't pre booked assistance but were allocated to board on the abulift. 2 of us in wheelchairs in my party were left on the tarmac whilst the special assistance and Ryanair argued about the fact the pilot wouldn't take more than 4! We got as far as the tarmac, sat for 10 minutes in the freezing cold wind whilst they tried to say we couldnt board. We were totally humiliated asked if we really needed to use the abulift and asked to prove wed booked special assistance, thankfully I always keep the paperwork safe. No other disabled passengers who were elderly were asked. It seems if you are young you can be challenged whether or not you actually need the help.  Ryanair staff would not help and it took one of the special assistance staff to say how ridiculous and bad the situation was, for us to actually get on the plane. We were told shortly before we may not be able to fly as its Ryanair policy that they only take 4 disabled people who cant climb the aircraft stairs. Maybe when Ryanair take your money they should let you know this. 4 people on a whole flight is beyond ridiculous, it does not take into consideration that most people with mobility problems or chronic illness would find it very difficult to climb steps and carry a hand luggage bag, forget those who are confined to a chair.

Also, it looked as if his shirt apparently hadn't been ironed for a few weeks. Ordered a drink and a sandwich, was prompted to pay €17. After having done the maths for the stewardess, the price was suddenly €10. Ryanair has some kind of lottery sale onboard their flights.

The negatives (which mainly focus on Stansted). Absolutely useless ground staff, once the departure gate was eventually flashed up on screen we joined the heaving mass crushed onto the little shuttle to the gate for a mad dash (due to the short notice). Once we arrived at the lounge, we were met with total chaos due to zero management (none visible). Queues were criss crossing each other and people were getting most upset. I asked one of only two staff checking two different flights (no other staff were available) which queue was which, to which she replied, ""I don't know it's all over the place back there"". Once we got to our desk, the lady checking us did not make eye contact, she simply looked at the pass glanced at our passports and said go through, an opportunity for a security check missed. After walking across the cold wet runway we got to the plane to find out that the back door had only just been opened, so of course earlier boarders had had to use the front door, which of course meant utter chaos on board. Anyway a second security check was missed here as the girl checking our seat passes only looked at one. Come on Ryanair, you seriously need to sort out this appalling issue. Who is to blame?

Apart from that possible catch in the booking process, everything else about our Ryanair experience was fine. Boarding was efficiently handled and even a difficulty with our boarding passes - the barcodes could not be read - caused no comment. The cabin crew did sterling work managing to stow everyone's cabin bags in overhead lockers, even telling passengers whose bags had to be located away from their seats where exactly their bags were to be found. There certainly seems to be a more customer-friendly approach from Ryanair these days and we are less apprehensive about being caught out in some minor, but expensive, infringement.

At approx 9:15, the notice boards stated we had to board again, but from a different gate. The plane was fully boarded by 9:45am. The doors were closed at 10:02am, and we took off at 10:15am. This was a delay of 2 hours and 15 minutes. The captain said it was down to Spanish air traffic control, they told us it was French air traffic control that caused the outbound delay. As Ryanair's terms state that if you are delayed by at least 2 hours, you will receive a text stating your rights, explaining compensation etc. No text received. When I challenged the stewards they said they thought it was 3 hours, not 2! Wow they didn't even know their own rules. They weren't willing to help at all and said I should just complain directly to Ryanair. Which I will be doing. The staff were more interested in selling as many snacks and drinks as possible, rather than apologising for the delay and issuing passengers with a food and drinks voucher.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Alicante,Edinburgh,October 2015,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,no,,

I had a nice cup of coffee on the flight and while it cost 50% more than I might have liked, it was good quality. The flight was not completely full so there were few issues with hand luggage and so on, and I like being able to take two bags with me as this saves a great deal of hassle. Downsides were due to Stansted's overcrowding. There is nowhere to sit while you wait for a flight, as they are rebuilding. The security is chaotic and unnecessarily stressful as they have not invested very intelligently in the screening equipment and they have rather bizarrely chosen hardware that increases rather than reduces processing time. Finally we were somewhat kettled in a holding bay near gate 88 by ground crew without explanation before boarding, while another flight disgorged its passengers, and I think it might have been better for Ryanair to send us down a bit later, as some of the families and older passengers grew uncomfortable with nowhere to sit. The Stansted experience is starting to put me off using EasyJet and Ryanair, and I often choose Heathrow and scheduled flights instead. In Ryanair's case, the cost difference between many of their tickets and a scheduled flight is now negligible and sometimes the scheduled flights are even cheaper and include more, so I wonder if Ryanair will be in business in a few years' time, despite their efforts to be less nasty to passengers.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Stansted,Marseille,October 2015,2.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,no,,

After emailing to ask for an explanation for this extortionate price hike - given that oil and fuel costs are at one of their lowest - I was dissatisfied with their response that they always offer the best price on their website (where else would I be looking?). The following is their list of price determining factors : number of passengers already booked on a flight : flight time : Day of travel : time of year - high season/low season etc. Given that we are travelling on the same flights and the same period which have virtually only just become available I fail to see how such a price increase can be justified other than pure greed and the mindset that they have a captive audience. As the accommodation had already been booked we had no option but to book Ryanair on this occasion but I can assure them that it will be my last flight with them.

We have always booked online and never had an issue with any other airline until it had come to our attention that we had to pay to sit together with was £20 each. At the time we assumed it was because we had booked short notice so we was fine to pay that. However, when we got to the airport (after checking in online a week before ) we were asked to pay £70 each for luggage on the way there and £35 each on the way back! I was so angry as there is nothing that states when you book your holiday that you have to ""check in"" your luggage too? The only question you are asked is if you want to check in ""extra luggage"" - well to me we didn't have extra it was just a standard suitcase and hand luggage (which pretty much everyone takes when they go away). So when you book online that's how they catch you out as they word it wrong by saying extra luggage rather than just a standard luggage. The staff were really abrupt and rude and not really bothered about the hassle this had caused us. Following this, my partner had to ask about luggage on the way back they didn't inform us. Again, there was nothing whilst we were booking to inform us that we had to do this only to check in ""extra luggage"" and I was not aware that my only suitcase had to be classed as extra. Its very misleading!  We normally don't take our bank cards with us on holiday but its a good job we did. To everyone that reads this please take it on board as some people may not be able to afford that kind of money upfront when they charge you which was what happened to the couple in front of us! The staff at the desk said that the information was in the ""small print"" which I think is awful as a vital piece of information like that, in my opinion, should not be in the small print! I have never known so much hassle to go on holiday in all my life and we have booked before with other airlines online and never ever had any issues with luggage. We will never fly with Ryanair again and strongly advise to anyone who is thinking of flying with them to think carefully and go with another airline if you can as you will probably end up paying again what you pretty much paid for the holiday.

1524,2015-09-26,3,United Kingdom,,"""you realise their service is quite flaky""","This is a review based on my Ryanair experiences at Madrid Barajas airport on 23 September 2015. I arrived 2 hrs early at around 1130 for the 1335 flight. At around 1300 our Boarding Cards were checked and we went down the ramp to embark. At around 1320 we were asked to return to the Departure Lounge due to a technical issue. For the next 3 hrs we were not advised of the issue nor of the plans to get us back to the UK. Gradually over that time people would ask the 2 (relatively junior) staff members of Ryanair and 'news', or lack of it, would filter down the line. No announcements were made. By around 1700 we heard that a plane was on its way and we would depart at around 1930. Ok, 6 hrs delay but at least we'd be home. The 2 officials then handed out photocopies of the EU regulations regarding flight delays etc - useful, but to be honest we just wanted to get home! As can be imagined, people then were asking lots of questions of the 2 lads. At around the same time food vouchers were being handed out and stamped by the 2 officials. However, not one of the food outlets would take the vouchers because Ryanair had tried this in the past and had not paid their bills to the food outlets! At around 1830 the 1930 departure disappeared off the departures list. We heard that another flight had been delayed and our rescue plane had been used for those passengers - presumably to avoid 2 sets of compensation!! Time progressed slowly, we then found out that a flight would take us back to the UK around 2305. The flight actually left at 2330 - 10 hrs late. During the 10 hrs, the 200 or so customers were shunted at least 5 times between Gates - can you imagine 200 people racing around getting from A to B! Ok, these things happen. Lessons to be learnt?  Ryanair, have someone on the ground such as a manager to deal with the situation and inform people officially by adequate communication. Pay your bills to the local food outlets. Having reported all the above, I've travelled extensively for the past few years to Spain and back and used Ryanair a lot. Mostly they are cheap and get you there on time; its just at times such as the above where you realise their service is quite flaky.

1525,2015-09-25,1,Germany,,"""service is just the worst""","Ryanair seems attractive because of their cheap prices, but their service is pretty lousy. My flight to London was delayed for almost 3 hours; none of the staff at the gate informed us about what was going on and what the reason for the delay was (only when people started walking up to them and asked, everyone kind of found out from the people sitting next to them). Conveniently the flight was delayed just a little under 3 hours so you're not even able to claim a refund. Because of the delay I missed my connecting flight in London (it was already about 8pm), which is why I went to ask for assistance. Their employee was pretty rude and offered no help; she just told me that I booked the two flights at my own risk and that I wasn't gonna get any assistance by Ryanair. Unfortunately there was no flight left to my final destination that day (which I would have had to pay out of my own pocket, of course), which is why I had to book an overnight bus and had a horrible 24hr trip instead of 8 hrs. On my flights back everything luckily went smoothly, but I noticed that boarding was really chaotic at all flights (a woman with her baby in a stroller was pretty much first in line to board and had to wait about 20 mins until all other passengers had boarded to get some help carrying the stroller down the stairs - of course, staff also weren't able to turn on the escalator at least). I wouldn't fly with Ryanair again, because despite their (in my case not even that cheap) prices their service is just the worst I've ever experienced. I've gone on many flights and faced many delays but have always received assistance and been booked on another flight/hotel etc at the airline's expense.

We had been queuing for nearly an hour and we could not check in online despite all of our attempts. I showed them the correspondence I received from their own staff about our difficulty checking in. Despite our efforts we were turned away. I spent nearly £900 on a wasted trip as the Ryanair online system and staff was appalling.

To begin with, they do not have airport check-in and boarding pass printing. Their system is based on the customer bringing his/her boarding pass ahead of time. We did not realise this, and they send us to pay 50 Euros for each ticket (for a family of 5 it was 250 Euros). Payments are done in a different ""office"", so I had to go there and stand for 20 min in a very unorganized line. When I came back to check-in the agent was very upset that we didn't pay for our suitcases, almost yelling at us. Guess what? we didn't know about this as well. So now she sent me again for the same ""office"" to pay another 200 Euros. Now, however there is only one line instead of two, so it takes another 30 minutes to pay the fee. Overall, their service is the worst that I've experienced. They make you feel as if they are doing you a favor for allowing you to fly their planes.

However the ridiculous add-on charges (55x4 euros per check-in at the airport fee + 67euros for a 22 kg luggage) made it cost much much more. I understand the luggage fee. However 220 euros airport check-in fee is twice the price of our total ticket cost! Finding this cost info on their website is almost impossible (it is literally hidden on the website - you have to search for that particular thing really). Their ""don't forget to check-in online"" e-mails can easily be ignored because they don't mention any airport check-in fee. It looks like a choice, not a must-do. At least three more couple of people paid that meaningless fee. Because they were not aware of it. If this airlines were for budget travelers and really cared about customer service, they would warn travelers about those ridiculous add-on fees. A fee should offer a service, so its value should be reasonable compared with the service it gives. So we paid 220 euros for a single check-in (not four - because normal airlines do a single check-in per reservation) done by a sour-faced check-in officer who scolded us like we were little kindergarden children.

I have a number of issues with this penalty charge, firstly; it is not clear on their web-site when making the on-line seat reservations and printing the boarding passes for the outbound flight that you need to make the same arrangements for the return flight (or is it Ryanair’s intention to catch out the new customers?) and secondly, I regularly travel for both business and pleasure with a number of different airlines and have never come across such a policy for boarding passes.

When we asked what we should give the girls to drink, the air steward advised red bull! Otherwise they had tomato juice!

You pay a small fare and they get you where you want to go. The cabin was not luxurious nor was it as clean as a British Airways one but we didn't expect it to be. Didn't love having the safety card stuck at eye-level on the seat in front but again, this is a budget airline. Had a very quick taxi and takeoff from Stagnated which was great and the landing at Krakow was smooth. Great pilots. Love the comical fanfare as you touchdown. Disembarking the plane was quick and we were with our reserved taxi within 20 minutes. On the way back we chose priority boarding which i would very much recommend, especially when its an evening flight and you just want to get home.

No one wanted to help or give me answer to the fact by law there not allowed to fly without a parent but yet you feel it's ok to separate my children from their mother. In the end a passenger actually moved so I could sit with my young children, if he hadn't my daughter would have been made to sit in the corner with 2 men who actually got really drunk and had to be spoken to on several occasions. I was told it's all to do with balance I've never heard anything so ridiculous.

That is when she told me that because the flight was full, I would be allowed to check in my one rolling bag free of charge. After security, boarding of the flight was impressive in terms of smoothness and professionalism. There were two lines: priority for those who prepaid their seat and general for those who chose not to spend a few extra euros for excellent service and benefits. The priority line has seats for passengers but the general boarding did not. I was the first to board. I quickly found my aisle exit row seat and sat. The flight attendant walked by and asked that I store the hand bag I had with me in the overhead as it was an exit row. Priority boarding was relaxed and more civilized. Print boarding pass before you get to the airport. If you printed your boarding pass, you can go directly to the gate.

Had booked early for a good price and managed to check in for return flight at home before leaving for Liverpool airport early in the morning, so avoided any extra charges. Did have a 30 minutes delay on the outward journey which was attributed to Belgian ATC because of the ""very busy skies over Europe this morning"", but since boarding (for an early morning flight) did not start till about 20 minutes before scheduled departure time I suspect we simply missed our designated slot. Also there was a puzzling request from the cabin manager that passengers should make sure they sat in their allocated seats because of the carefully arranged weight distribution. Given that the plane was completely full, how and where was weight distribution arranged? Plenty of sales pitches on both legs, but my impression was that many of the passengers just switched off and sales were actually fewer than on flights I've had with easyJet. None of the past quibbling over cabin baggage and even on the full outward flight everyone seemed to get their bags stowed in the lockers with crew members' assistance.

Our plane (FR7974) left late (after a late inbound arrival). I was sitting in Row 2. There was a minimal announcement from the flight deck naming the crew but nothing to invite the passengers to listen attentively to the safety briefing, which is often the final point made during the cockpit pre-flight passenger announcement. The announcement was very quiet and the delivery was monotone. I appreciate that the flight deck crew wanted to get a slot and head back to London as quickly as possible so their priorities might be elsewhere. The pasenger safety briefing was voiced by the female cabin crew member but it was impossible to hear (even in row 2). Even the young man doing the demonstration seemed frustrated by the lack of interest being shown. When I asked the female cabin crew why she had not stopped the briefing and reminded the passengers to pay attention, she told me it was not really worth it, because 'they (the passengers) wouldn't do it and anyway they fly so regularly that they don't need to listen to it because they know what to do by now'. The drinks run and duty free run were very speedy, leading to the crew spending around 10 mins in the forward galley area spilling out into the aisle in full sight of the passengers each with a mobile phone in their hand and chatting. Apart from the young man cabin crew at the front who made a personal, animated and delightful appeal for the scratch card run, and whose cabin service was friendly and most welcome, this cabin crew seemed to be the most uninterested and switched off that I have travelled with in over 15 years of travelling with Ryanair.

It was odd that the airport did not announce departure gate numbers until an hour beforehand, but it wasn't a big deal. I personally enjoyed doing some shopping and getting a bit to eat before heading to the gate. The boarding was fairly effortless, although Ryanair did not call us by seat number. This resulted in a big bulge of customers at the start of boarding, so we just sat back down and waited. The flight was on-time, We had a pleasant, short flight to Cork. Cork Airport was beautiful and it didn't look like there were many flights arriving that time - our visit through customs was brief and very friendly.

This made the flights no cheaper than the ones that other airlines offered. The cabin - despite pictures on the internet - looked gloomy, old fashioned and dirty.

Both flights were more or less on time, and the outward boarding was quite smooth. The bad. On the outward flight awful overpriced food was offered and there were 2 ‘scratch card runs ‘. On a two and a half hour flight? There being no on board magazine or duty free menu is it any wonder nobody buys any duty free goods – nobody has any idea what is for sale. At the end of the flight there was no thanks or goodbye as we left the plane the first time in 35 years I have ever had this. The two cabin crew by the rear doors totally ignored the departing passengers whilst chatting in their own language. Very unprofessional cabin crew that day. On the journey back the cabin crew were much better. There was only one scratchcard run and one hard sell on the breakfast lasagne that ‘melted in your mouth ‘. No thanks. Our real issue as we were waiting in the queue (towards the back) to embark a ground staff came up the line and attached yellow stickers to our hand luggage and boarding pass. She spoke no English, and we eventually worked out our hand luggage (which was all we had by choice) was now going in the hold. This was a bit of a disaster for us as we were now being forced to wait at the baggage reclaim at the other end , a wait which proved to be about half an hour meaning we overshot out car parking time and had to pay excess. Despite this sticker business some people behind us in the queue were removing the stickers prior to embarking and just taking the luggage on the plane anyway. But we played the game and tried to safeguard some delicate stuff we had. Despite this on arrival home we found that some articles were damaged, something that should never have happened in the first place. So, in a nutshell if you are prepared to forsake everything for a cheap flight Ryanair are the best in the business. If the travelling is a big part of your trip, avoid them like the plague.

A few of our fellow passengers were an issue, with what we understood to be their pre-emptively abrupt attitude with staff which was mildly unpleasant and entirely unnecessary but perhaps a hangover of Ryanair of old.

When we eventually go to the front the check in clerk next to our queue (without any notice) closed his queue and then his queue tried to push into ours.

These extras added up to about 100% to the initial price tag but even then it was quite cheap (some 70USD one-way all inclusive). There was no trouble with booking as well as with online check in. I was even able to download mobile boarding pass through the app. At the airport I only spent abut 10 minutes for bag check and visa verification. At the gate my experience was not overly pleasant with some 200 people with screaming children left on the stairs leading to the apron for about 20 minutes. Then door opened and crowd went to the plane. Since I booked priority boarding I had no trouble reaching my seat and accommodating my bag. The crew were polite and helpful. Since their hand baggage limit is strict there was no problem finding space for bags. We took off on time. The inflight experience was up to expectations but not as annoying as some wrote here. No seat recline but plenty of legroom in emergency row. The plane was very tatty but clean. Toilet was ok. We landed 10 mins ahead of schedule. Then usual labyrinth of Stansted terminal and unbelievable immigration lines for EU citizens. Due to being Ukraine national I was directed to the non-EU line which consisted of some 15-20 people so it took me 10 minutes to pass border control.

We were firstly informed that a delay of 1.5 hours was estimated. After a while we were informed that another 1 hour had been added. So all passengers sat on the plane for 2.5 hours. Our first complaint - Sitting in a stationary hot metal tube for 2.5 hours is not my idea of enjoyment particularly when nobody was offered even the smallest drink of complimentary cold water in order to alleviate the discomfort. During the 2.5 hour delay there would have been time to have some water delivered. The irony in all of this is that shortly after take-off the cabin crew came round selling drinks. Our second complaint - Flight FR9015 Thursday 7th May - El Prat to Stansted. Taking advantage of the 10kg on board baggage allowance + small bag we purchased a second ""carry on"" cabin bag (size within stipulated regulation). On the outward journey not a problem. A different story on the return flight though. On entry to the plane I was told by a Stewardess ""That is not a cabin bag!"" I explained that we had no problems on the outward journey the cabin crew were quite happy. Not being convinced she repeated the statement ""That is not a cabin bag!"" I again repeated my statement and then went to take my seat and stow my cabin bag. Little knowing that my wife was behind me she said again in a rather snide voice ""That is not a cabin bag!""

I am meticulous about measuring hand luggage as I do not want to be charged extra but the shapes and sizes of bags being allowed on was hilarious- some people looked like they'd packed for a 3 week cruise. Everything was allowed on and massive bags which would never have fitted in the cabin were allowed in the hold free of charge. Overhead lockers were completely crammed with massive hand luggage items. All in all does what it says on the tin - got us there and back alive and well on time at a good price.,,,Economy Class,,,,4.0,3.0,4.0,,4.0,yes,,
1652,2015-05-27,1,South Africa,,Ryanair customer review,I booked a fairly priced return ticket between Dublin and Edinburgh in May 2015. The experience was horrible. I think the check-in and baggage drop works okay as long as you only have hand luggage and a European or UK passport. If you need to check in a bag or you require a visa it's absolute chaos. There is no clear signage the staff keeps directing you to a different queue that already has at least 50 people waiting. This was the closest I've ever come to missing a flight. The price of my ticket increased threefold with the bag I checked in (less than 20kg btw) and they even charge 15 euro to print your boarding pass. This borders on criminal if you ask me. I will never ever fly with Ryanair again and I will go out of my way to let people know how bad the service is.,,,Economy Class,,,,2.0,1.0,0.0,,2.0,no,,

1654,2015-05-25,8,Italy,,Ryanair customer review,FR4774 May 14th and FR4775 May 18th. I have never been a fan of this airline but I have to admit they are moving forward and slowly getting closer to what I consider to be an enjoyable carrier to fly with (for short haul flights). Flew BGY to SKG last week for a short Greek holiday with no issue at all: on time departures/arrivals good rate for the ticket and above all some improvements I did notice compared to the last time I flew with them about 3 years ago. The main one is of course the seat allocation for everyone which prevent people from rushing to the aircraft as if it was a bus school trip. I also found seat comfort and legroom to have improved and even the cabin crew seems a bit more professional and friendly now even if they still talk too much in my opinion during the flight to try and sell whatever the can to the passengers. Another positive news is that there is no longer (at least according to my experience) an obsessive check of your hand baggage dimensions and weight at the gate which I do appreciate. Generally speaking if you check the rules carefully and comply with them you can get a great value for money as well as good and frequent direct connections. The day they stop boarding the plane half an hour before the plane is actually ready to welcome passengers onboard (thus causing people to wait on the stairs/bus/apron for up to 15 minutes) they will probably see me much more often on their planes.,,,Economy Class,,,,3.0,3.0,0.0,,4.0,yes,,
1655,2015-05-22,7,United Kingdom,,Ryanair customer review,MAN-PMI-MAN. Usually fly with easyJet from Liverpool but Ryanair schedules appeared first and I found cheap flights for our preferred days. Had a later bonus in that our original outward flight in the evening was cancelled and we were transferred to the morning flight which had been dearer at the time of booking. I read all the rules carefully and intended to pay for seats so that we could print off our return boarding passes before we left home. I was subsequently shocked to find that even standard seats would cost £10.99 per person per flight and this was not even high season. In the end I got up extra early on the morning of our outward journey and printed off the return passes at 02.15! It was noticeable that hardly any standard seats had been booked in advance: perhaps if the charge was less Ryanair would actually find more people choosing to pay. The flights themselves went off largely without incident. We were late departing from Manchester but then we did not start to board the plane until 15 minutes before official departure time yet this was early in the morning. I found it difficult to hear any of the announcements partly because of the noise of the engines and passengers talking loudly to compensate but also because of the gabbled way in which they were delivered. The return crew were much better in this respect despite the senior steward looking to be all of 14 years of age. Not much attention seemed to be paid to luggage sizing and it looked as if everyone got their hand luggage on board despite a completely full outward flight. Both crews worked hard throughout the flights but we were starting to descend towards Mallorca before the drinks round reached us on the outward leg. Overall though one cannot complain when we paid under £120 for two of us to fly to Mallorca for a week. When we first went there over 20 years ago we were lucky to find return flights for £200 per person in low season.,,,Economy Class,,,,3.0,4.0,0.0,,5.0,yes,,

1657,2015-05-18,2,Spain,,Ryanair customer review,I have been a passenger with numerous airlines since 1957 and in recent years frequently from Alicante to several different British airports. Ryanair is one of the worst I've ever travelled with and definitely the worst on this route. On the outward Alicante/East Midlands Airport journey we sat on the runway for almost an hour because they had missed their slot. This made for a long and tedious journey. This however was nowhere near as bad as the return flight. We left plenty of time to return the hire car and arrive at the airport in time to have a leisurely lunch (as we always do at Gatwick) as we knew that it would be late when we arrived home only to discover that we could not enter the departure lounge until 2 hours before our flight was due to leave. This would have been okay if there had been somewhere for two elderly passengers to sit (all chairs were taken and we were left standing with all our luggage) or somewhere to have a decent meal (there is one very unappetising place with food served in cardboard). Also two hours would have been sufficient time if it hadn't taken more than an hour to wind our way through the queue to the check in desk. When we arrived at the desk we were told that our case was too heavy (1kg overweight) most airlines will waive this fractional overweight but the representative told us that we had only paid for 15kg and would have to put the excess in our hand baggage. This we did in full view of the other passengers and consisted of 2 tee-shirts and a pair of light shoes. Whilst we were waiting to board the aircraft the attendant asked us if we would like to put our hand baggage in the hold free of charge! My logic and fairly basic grasp of maths cannot make sense of this! I had been warned not to travel Ryanair and I never will again.,,,Economy Class,,,,3.0,2.0,2.0,,3.0,no,,

At the gate Ryanair staff discussed who would not be able to take the flight as there were too many disabled. They talked about us as if we were bags of carrots. Eventually I said I would try to climb the steps of the aircraft and was allowed onto the plane. At no time was I given any assistance. On arrival in Malta I had to struggle to baggage and out of the airport as no assistance was available. You need to be fit and agile to use this airline.

We only travelled with hand luggage and took great care to make sure the sizes were correct but I notice not everyone does and there isn't checking at all all sorts of shapes and sizes go through even the handbag sizes.

1663,2015-05-13,7,Ireland,,Ryanair customer review,A return trip from Dublin to Malaga for a friends wedding the flight over left slightly late due chaotic boarding by the pax who seemed rather clueless as to what to do once you board a plane so you can't blame Ryanair for that. As per my last flights on FR they ran out of food and drink items and had a very limited selection and the service by a crew with a combined age of about 17 were slow and one rather got the impression that the four of them had just qualified the previous afternoon. They seemed stressed by the whole process and were again slow from the aft galley which is a surprise considering the lack of items they could possibly sell. There was a minor medical emergency where a pax fainted but they were quick and very attentive to deal with the situation. The flight back was again bereft of items from to purchase which was odd given that the plane was sitting on the ground the whole time I was at the gate before boarding (over an hour) but then even when you want to purchase something it's a bit of a guessing game due to the fact there are no menus. Anyway the flight began boarding early so early there were neither flight nor cabin crew on board. The flight itself was an awful experience due to being surrounded by children who took to screaming the majority of the time while their parents looked like they wanted to chuck themselves out the window. If I thought that the front of the cabin were an adults only area I would have paid anything to sit there maybe something to think about? All-in-all Ryanair are fine and are improving but it wouldn't be any harm to send mystery shoppers and auditors on flights occasionally to see what is really going on and realistically running out of the toilet paper hand towels. hand soap and saleable things like water is fairly unacceptable from a pax perspective.,,,Economy Class,,,,2.0,2.0,3.0,,4.0,yes,,

I prefer to wait until the queue is actually moving and join the queue then instead of standing for no reason. No complaints about the flight - I think some of the food/drinks are overpriced but in general there is a good selection. I have noticed on recent Ryanair flights that the level of customer service have improved. There seems to be more Irish and British crew on the Irish and British flights too. I noticed the crew were especially friendly with the children on board with 2 young kids being shown into the cockpit as they saw the pilot on exiting the plane and the male cabin crew member on the tramac waving at other children as they came down the aircraft steps. Flight was good going back as well arriving in Dublin area. Great service for just £20 return.,,,Economy Class,,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,,5.0,yes,,

It may be said that one gets what one pays for but by the time Ryanair has ripped through you with thier suite of extra charges many of which are simply an unfair cash grab on their unsuspecting customers at the booking counter when there is no chance of taking another airline Ryanair is not well priced. On a flight from Dublin to Bristol we were encouraged to use Ryanairs smartphone App or print out out a boarding pass to avoid an extra charge to have it printed at the booking counter. Unfortunately the App didn't work so on arriving at Dublin we were directed to the misnamed 'Customer Service' counter to be 'helped' by the most unhelpful unpleasant rude eye rolling young woman I have ever had the misfortune to encounter in many years of air travel with many airlines all over the world. When I explained the problem she tried to tell me that if the App didn't work I had plenty of time in Ireland to hunt down an Internet cafe or similar with access to a printer to print out my boarding pass and that she should now charge me for printing them out at the airport. I was then charged for an extra 3kg of baggage even though the two of us had no carry on baggage. The plane was dirty tired and run down and the cabin staff non professional. The seats are small and cramped. In summary terrible service from rude staff will strip you of cash any chance they get tired dirty aircraft poor inflight service.

The maitre d' shouted and yelled and my son who expressed his concern regarding fresh air and cooler air temperature in the cabin. Ryanair is a budget airline and I'm aware of that but budget does not mean poor maintenance and rude and unfriendly flight crew. As a very frequent airline passenger I must point out that there are more and more budget airlines in the world and competition for the passengers is tougher every single day.

Surprised to be allocated the same back row seat for both flights even though I'd not paid for seat choice. I thought these rear (and front) seats cost extra? Anyway not complaining as it meant speedy disembarkation at both destinations. Good to see that the Ryanair charm offensive has not run out of steam and they really do seem to be making serious efforts to up their public image. Return leg absolutely full but boarding was efficient enough and we arrived 20 mins early. Both flights were on two of FR's more elderly planes (those in the EI-DC* range) and frankly they are starting to show a lot of wear and tear which is hardly surprising when you consider how hard they work. Have the food and drink prices gone up recently? £4.50 for a coffee and a biscuit seems a bit OTT to me but I guess you don't have to buy. In summary a couple of years ago I'd have advised anyone to avoid Ryanair at all costs if there was even a vaguely convenient alternative.

The yellow tagging farce is actually funny to watch - the policy as I was rudely told is the ""first 90 bags"" however it was totally random with customers with large trolley bags walking through and then other customers behind them being tagged?! There is no correct monitoring system for this whatsoever so you are at the mercy of the poorly trained staff on the gate.

When we arrived at our seats there was no room in the overhead stow for our luggage as other passengers had obviously ran out of space in their own areas and decided just to cram 4 cases into ours leaving us with nothing. My husband had to try and make room for our bags in stows away from where we were sitting. During this the cabin crew just gormlessly stood by and offered no assistance. Menus were handed out but only to passengers in the front seats as they didn't have enough to go round. It was a lunchtime flight and I was hungry and asked the stewardess while she was passing with the trolley if I could buy a panini. I was told they had ran out (again as there was only enough for the passengers in the front seats). No alternative was offered. The staff looked tired and fed up. Also there was a hen do on board with one idiot randomly shouting at the top of her voice. I didn't see any cabin crew addressing this. I would only fly Ryanair for very short flights if desperate.

Overall the service wasn't too bad they left on time and popping cabin baggage into the hold at the last minute is a great idea really speeds up the boarding process once you're on board. Just back from Barcelona the flight over was as good as any but they ran out of certain items so one wonders what pax on the way back did for food and certain drinks and frankly the seat stays comfortable for just about the duration of the flight. Turns out I didn't have to wonder what the pax on the way back did there was barely even a bottle of water left on the plane I flew home on. The inflight service from the the back was incredibly slow which probably had something to do with the fact that the crew in this section clearly did not get along. This was maybe due to the lazy attitude of one of them who declared quite audibly that she wasn't walking back to the galley to fetch something as she ""couldn't be bothered"". I've been on a couple of FR flights in the past while where the cabin crew did not get along nor try to hide it at all which is something they could look at somehow. On the whole though I don't mind flying FR once you know what you're at and what to expect then you shouldn't have a major issue.",,,Economy Class,,,,2.0,3.0,3.0,,4.0,yes,,
1686,2015-04-22,,United Kingdom,,Ryanair customer review,Enjoyed a wonderful nine day break in Spain/Portugal. This whole break was marred by the Ryanair who think its acceptable to charge 140 euros for a two minute process of online check in which I had already done - funny how all our personal/passport details were already there along with the 'premium' seats I booked at the time of online checking in of our return flight. As we were in remote places with an old blackberry phone we were prepared to pay the still unreasonable boarding pass printing charge. Ryanair are in the position where they can hold you hostage until you pay. Their trump card is the fact we all have to get home even if it means paying a ransom to get there and they are not interested in considering the 'customer' might be right.,,,Economy Class,,,,2.0,3.0,0.0,,1.0,no,,

1689,2015-04-14,8,United States,,Ryanair customer review,"Four of us flew from Stansted (London) to Dublin on Good Friday April 3 2015. The gate crew and on-board crew were all friendly cheery and helpful the plane itself was surprisingly comfortable (muchmore comfortable than the United 757s we flew to/from Dublin the week before) and on-board food and beverage choices were decent and not horribly pricey. We departed promptly on time arrived on time and getting on/off was efficiently managed by the crew. Nearly everyone else on our flight was part of a huge school trip (kids about 12-14 plus their ""keepers"") and the crew members were great with the kids - kept them as organized as possible and were flexible about changing seat assignments so that friends could sit together - very nice to see! Here are the only two reasons I didn't give Ryanair an overall ""10"" rating: 1) I received mobile-phone alerts reminding me to do online check-in and get mobile boarding passes. Sounds easy enough but after four tries I was still unable to input our information - no explanation given. Finally on the fifth try it worked: I added all of the requested info (passport numbers etc.) for our party and then got a message saying ""We are unable to issue mobile boarding passes"" - again no explanation at all. Since I didn't have access to a computer or printer I began to panic especially after reading that there was a fee of 70 pounds per person to check in at the airport! Thank heavens our B&B owner came to the rescue and offered me the use of his personal computer and printer to complete the online check-in and print boarding passes. 2) We arrived at Stansted with more than two hours to spare before our flight got through security in record time and began checking the boards to see which gate we'd depart from. We sat down in the Coast to Coast restaurant to grab brunch while waiting all the while keeping an eye on the Departures board but out gate number wasn't posted until 15 minutes before departure time! Worse it turned out that our gate was a nearly 10-minute walk from the restaurant so all of on this flight had to do a mad dash for the gate at (almost) the last minute. I've never ever seen a gate number posted so late in the game especially when the gate was fairly far away - that was just baffling.

The crew were polite and helpful but despite offering an extensive 'cafe' service the only food available was a hot panini. As others have mentioned families were split as the flight was full then these people expected others to move so they could be together. I was not asked but others were annoyed. The flight was delayed and I lost count of the times the cabin crew and pilot stressed it was because of earlier problems at Manchester Airport not their fault.

This was due to strong winds and was a safety precaution fair enough I hear you say. This isn't really my gripe but the after care. The cabin crew told us that coaches were being laid on and would be a few minutes to arrive after around an already 1hr delay however when we went to the Ryan Air desk the representative advised she knew nothing about the 120+ passengers or any coaches! After being kept waiting she eventually told us that some coaches were being arranged what happened to the one that were a few minutes away? After a 3hr wait sat on a cold floor (no seating) the coaches turned up and we were face with a 1hr 45m journey to Leeds.

At check in desk they spent 5 minutes checking my documents since not many non-eu travelers use this service. They even printed me a ""conventional"" boarding pass. At the gate there was an expected 15 min wait in a crowd on the stairs leading to apron. Not pleasant for parents with crying children all around but bearable for solo traveler. A short walk to the plane then got to my seat. Since it was an exit seat can't say anything about standard legroom. What I had was fine. No seat recline. The seat was ok. Announcements were not noisy. Flight took off late and landed before schedule. I didn't buy anything onboard. Long walk on arrival. Bag on the belt when I was off the immigration. Don't have an idea what if things went wrong but what I got for my money was predictable and trouble free. Other options from Gdansk to London were Wizzair known for carry-on charges or conventional airlines with higher prices and transfers at major hubs. I preferred direct service.

On a recent flight home from Gdansk I decided to ask the crew for a card since I figured that they would not voluntarily offer one. The crew member stated that they would bring one and did bring me some sort of card which was half in Arabic half in French which appeared to be for passengers arriving in Morocco. It was completely different to the standard form. Later in the flight I spoke to another member of the crew about it pointing out that it was the wrong type of card. She giggled and mumbled something about hanging onto it 'just in case.' I pointed out that she was not making any sense. How hard would it be to carry some landing cards on the flight? If this is for some reason not possible then perhaps the staff need better training in terms of what to do if a passenger request one.

Calculating a 5 hour delay I immediately asked to be disembarked - the capt responded immediately arranging stairs and ground crew. In minutes we were off with helpful crew around. As we entered the terminal the airport announced closure and the flight delayed by 90 minutes plus. Fact was it departed 4 hours 46 minutes later. We cancelled our seats. A few hours later I received an email advising that I could claim a refund or another flight. I opted for a refund and a few hours later received confirmation the refund had been processed!,,,Economy Class,,,,2.0,5.0,4.0,,4.0,yes,,

On arrival at Gatwick the stairs were moved to the door ready for us to disembark but there seemed to be a problem and the cabin crew did not open the door. We sat there and waited and waited but not once did any member of the cabin crew explain to us why we were still sitting there. Eventually after some considerable time we used our own initiative and used the exit at the back of the plane. At no time did the Ryanair staff say anything! So much for Health and Safety. Seats were cramped and uncomfortable but as I am only 5ft 4ins not too bad for me but must be horrid if you are tall with long legs.

Check in desk was opened an hour before boarding and manned by one person. On the other side (for premium members?) there were 2 more employees but they were too busy giggling and messing around to consider taking a few passengers off the hands of the sole employee for economy. he was very friendly/quick and didn't seem at all jaded or phased that it was him vs 200 plus people. As I was in the front of the line my wait was short. The flight was full and everybody seemed to have carry on that well exceeded the limit so I was glad I paid the extra and checked my bag. Nobody was called out re succeeding the luggage limits so overhead space was at a premium but they got it all stowed. Cabin comfort was average and flight crew were pleasant enough. Arrived on time/luggage was offloaded quickly. All in all it was still a great price and well worth the money for the convenience of a short direct flight.,,,Economy Class,,,,4.0,4.0,0.0,,4.0,yes,,

My wife was allocated a seat in the second row and I was allocated a seat in the very last row even though there were plenty of seats vacant together elsewhere in the plane. There was no organisation with regards to queues re both checking in and boarding the plane. When we landed we had to wait for ages to disembark as the ground staff forgot to bring the steps out for the front of the plane and then when went through customs we were asked for our landing passes which we did not have as they were not given out by staff as they were supposed to be.

It was freezing. We eventually boarded and we sat for 1 hour 50 minutes whilst waiting for an explanation as to why we were sitting waiting to depart. We were told that Knock airport staff were clearing the running when out of the sky arrives an inbound flight. Neither the cabin crew or the flight deck crew told us anything other than there was going to be a ten minute delay.

Eventually it arrived and we were called to await boarding. We were then told to cross the tarmac to the plane for boarding. However when we reached the plane we were not allowed to board. There was a barrier over both entrances to the plane. The whole plane-load of passengers were kept outside on the tarmac in windy freezing conditions for about 15 minutes. There were babes in arms tiny children and elderly people standing outside a plane we had been given permission to board in freezing conditions. People in the queues were shouting to be allowed to board to no avail. When I returned home I wrote to Ryanair: requesting an explanation as to why passengers were called to board before the plane was ready when the plane was parked just outside the Airport buildings and also asking that the explanation be passed on to all adult passengers aboard that flight. I thought that would be the very least they could do.

1738,2015-01-14,5,United Kingdom,,Ryanair customer review,Ryanair is fine to fly most of the time to get from A to B and if you can go hand luggage only. But that isn't always possible and today at Alicante the Bag Drop was pretty shambolic and stressful having to queue for more than an hour to drop off a case with people getting more and more frantic as the clock ticked by. It might have been because they had about 6 full flights scheduled one after another in a 2 hour period and only 3 desks for bag drop off. Plus they were charging everyone who was even just slightly over the weight which led to queues being at a stand still as people tried to rearrange their luggage or go and sort out the extra payments. If this is a frequent occurrence (will be watching as am a frequent flier) I will definitely avoid Ryanair as much as possible in the future. I will and have paid the premium for the extra business fare but the huge omission is that there is no priority drop off. Unlike Easyjet who give priority at bag drop if you have speedy boarding/easyjet plus. Makes the business fare bundle all a bit pointless since you have allocated seats anyway. If Ryanair introduced a priority drop-off as an optional extra I would happily pay it rather than stand in a queue for an hour.,,,Economy Class,,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0,no,,

1742,2015-01-11,,United States,,Ryanair customer review,"Tallinn to Milan first and last time flying with Ryanair. Ryanair is by far the worst airline I have experienced in terms of customer service fees and travel experience. This was our first time flying with Ryanair and after booking our flight we were traveling often without internet service when we got to the airport to check-in 2 hours before our flight we were informed that there would be a 70Euro fee/person! We had no email from Ryanair about the need to check-in online 2 hours before departure. The online check-in cut-off time is arbitrary as it serves no purpose other than a deliberate tactic by Ryanair to extort additional funds from paying customers who at that point have no alternative but to pay and board the flight. We then were forced to wait in a crowded gate area and our flight departure was delayed by over an hour. During our time at the gate several Ryanair ""customer service"" agents made their way through the crowd demanding that some passengers must check their carry-on luggage. Almost every passenger with more than one carry-on item was ordered to leave their additional carry-on at the ground by the plane to load in to the hold. After making our way across the runway in freezing rain and snow we slowly made our way up the outdoor stairs to the plane only to be met with a surly male steward who was talking with a staff member instead of greeting passengers. All of the staff were rude and only spoke to passengers to ask to purchase items. Every item including water was provided only for a fee. We arrived in Milan only to be told that we had to sit on the plane to wait for a bus to take us to the terminal. One bus came and filled with passengers. We were in the back of the plane so we had to wait another long period for another bus. Bottom line - this was the worst travel experience in my 30 years of global travel. Yes the airline industry has changed significantly to cut costs and keep fares reasonable but there is no need to intentionally make customers feel worthless. I will gladly pay more for a flight to not be extorted for additional monies and to have a smile and a friendly hello delivered by the airline staff.",,,Economy Class,,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,no,,

1744,2014-12-31,2,United Kingdom,,Ryanair customer review,"My wife and I live in Spain and had booked a flight from Malaga to Stansted and a return flight from Stansted to Malaga some five weeks later. The night before our flight out of Malaga I duly went online to the Ryanair website to do the Online Check In. I filled in the flight details and submitted it then there was on option to print the Boarding Pass however I didn't have a printer my apartment so I assumed that since I had submitted the details all would be fine. This was not the case however. On arrival at Malaga Airport the next day we went to the Ryanair check in point that was at least 100 metres away from any other check in desk (probably so that other passengers could not hear any passenger complaints) We were asked for our Boarding Passes. I said that he had checked in online but had no way of printing the Boarding Pass. The Ryanair representative said that her computer was not showing that the Online Check In had been done. Although I insisted that I had submitted the Check In form online there was no way that I could prove it. The Ryanair Online Check In requires that the submit button is clicked on numerous times as it wants to sell extra luggage allowance hotels car hire and selected seats. If the submit button is not clicked on by-passing each of these selection options then the Online Check In does not go through. The Ryanair representative said that we would have to pay 70 Euros each for not submitting the Online Check In and for printing the Boarding Passes but as an alternative we were then told to take our laptop to the Ryanair Information Desk where they could have 15 minutes of free use of the Wi-Fi to find the details. The Wi-Fi was password protected however and the Ryanair staff member was not exactly showing any signs of wanting to help. I am of the opinion that it was extremely difficult if not impossible for a passenger to be able to retrieve the data. With time to board fast approaching we had no option but to pay 70 Euros each a Rip-Off total of 140 Euros to print two boarding passes.

In both destinations in Athens and Stansted I found the staff very polite and very helpful. They were very organised and I was pleasantly surprised. The seats on the aeroplane were not too comfortable but for a short trip it didn't matter. The plus point was that travelling with a small child the arms of the seat lifted up and being flat it was easier for my daughter to sleep on the journey. The only down point that I could say is that the staff talking on the intercom I could not understand very well their English or Greek. This could have been a fault of the intercom. I found them excellent and compared to other airlines very competitive. It was the first time I had travelled with them and would do it again.

The last year has seen a major improvement as a result of their charm offensive. Gone are the rugby scrums to get the best seats the petty case weighing and the inflexible enforcement of rules. Most of the recent flights I've been on (these two included) have been pretty full but there's been the opportunity to move to a less crowded section in spite of the usual 'not allowed due to weight and balance of the aircraft' nonsense trotted out by the purser at the start of the flight. I was surprised on the outbound sector that they used the jet way piers at BCN thereby loading from only the front door and rendering the boarding process rather chaotic and long-winded. First time I've ever seen this on a FR flight and you can see why they prefer a front and rear door approach. As always both flights were on time and it may just be that I've become immune to them but the intrusive sales related tannoy babble during the flight does seem to have been cut back.

This meant I could print off boarding passes at home for both legs of journey and with 10kg hand luggage (plus handbag) there was no queue to stand in at airport just straight to security. Fabulous! Liked the fact there was a priority boarding queue even though I wasn't in it. Boarding front and rear of plane. Very efficient. Flight on time. Plane clean and seemed plenty of room for everyone's luggage. The seat on the plane was one of the most comfortable I have encountered on a short haul carrier and I even managed to have a very relaxing shut eye. I have travelled with Thomas Cook several times recently and the flights were very uncomfortable. On outward leg of this journey I was at a window seat and was invisible to cabin crew however on return journey at aisle seat crew very pleasant and helpful.

We had no luggage to check in and had booked priority boarding. The flight was punctual both ways. The flight crew was polite. The reason that at times they have to be a bit pushy is that people take an eternity to get settled and low cost airline have to stick to strict time schedules. I hear lots of horror stories about Ryanair but I assume that if you stick to your part of the deal it is OK. I think for a short flight that we took it is very cost effective and one can overlook some small niggles here and there.,,,Economy Class,,,,3.0,4.0,0.0,,3.0,yes,,

I explained that I did not have access to a computer but that was no excuse - they said I would have to pay or I was not going anywhere. I had already paid 30 Euros for my piece of Luggage at time of booking so after paying and having requested wheelchair assistance on my original booking I was told to sit on a bench and wait. Eventually I was taken the departure gate only to be told after waiting 1/2 an hour and asking that the plane was 45 minutes late and would be leaving from a different gate. When we finally boarded - I did have priority boarding but that didn't seem to matter I had to walk across the tarmac to the plane and with much difficulty walk up the steps to the aircraft with my small carry on (I was not offered any assistance) to the last row. The last straw was when we were finally airborne I asked for a drink of water to take some medication and was told it would cost me 3 euros.

Had to pay for seats in order to print off boarding passes before leaving home so went the whole hog and paid for priority boarding as well. Didn't encounter any problems although the boarding agents did not arrive till 10 minutes before the gate was officially due to close. No checking of hand luggage dimensions nor application of ruling to allow first 90 bags only onboard as far as we could see so the last passengers to board were struggling to find locker space. Perhaps with a late night flight staff are more concerned about getting home as quickly as possible. Almost 15 minutes late taking off but made up time en route. Cabin crew were friendly and worked hard both helping passengers to stow bags and then later serving refreshments etc. Overall a relatively painless trip though not as relaxing as with easyJet. Minor gripes - the ""leather"" seats are rather unforgiving after a couple of hours and the announcements from the cabin and cockpit crew often difficult to hear as Ryanair's Boeings seem noisier than easyJet's Airbuses and crew tended to gabble anyway.",,,Economy Class,,,,2.0,4.0,3.0,,4.0,yes,,

Found there are no better routes connecting SVQ and GOT/GSE these flights were the best option. As a point to point airline Ryanair never puts any responsibilities for any delays causing missed connections. We had a sharp 2 hrs at Paris to catch the next flight while the first flight from Seville was delayed a slightly over an hour due to extreme weather. You cannot expect a better pilot on SVQ-BVA route who was very informative and explained to us the delay causing him to change the parking three times and eventually used the airbridge. Flight from BVA was delayed allowing us to have an extra time. Return journey was fine. All in all very satisfied with the flights. We enjoyed both food along the way. They are kind with the cabin baggage. Ryanair today seems to be the 2.0 version than the one in 2000's. Very pleasant flight!,,,Economy Class,,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,,5.0,yes,,
1781,2014-10-28,,United Kingdom,,Ryanair customer review,First and last experience with this airline. Outward flight from Leeds Bradford to Chania was OK and if it had been the same on the return flight then we would have flown with them again. Check in at Chania was an absolute shambles made worse by the fact I'd bought a bouzouki in Crete and was unaware of Ryanair's attitude to musical instruments. At the check in I was obliged to pay 60 Euro and had to have it placed in the hold. I accept the fact that a musical instrument can be a bit of a hazard on a plane but it would have easily have fitted in the overhead locker. None of the cabin crew on the return flight had English as a first language and were unable to offer me concise instruction on how I was to claim the instrument at Leeds Bradford. The menus were in Euros yet the cabin crew asked for payment in sterling with the inevitable delay whilst currency conversions were carried out. This slowed the catering service down so much that it wasn't worth bothering with. We paid extra for priority boarding although this does not seem to offer any priority at check-in and is a complete waste of time at Chania as staff try and make as much bonus as they can by finding oversize and overweight hand luggage. We were ignored by ground staff when we tried to use the Priority lane. It's a case of first come first served until one of the check in staff decides to stem the flow and call the priority passengers forward. We also paid a premium for extra legroom in row 16. The extra legroom was appreciated but the seats are very narrow with fixed armrests and were not very comfortable at all. Also the cabin crew are ruthless about loose items in that seat row and my wife was made to wear a cardigan she had on her lap until the aircraft had taken off. No doubt there will be many who are obliged to use this carrier to visit family or their holiday homes abroad and they will have obviously conditioned themselves to flying with Ryanair but I can assure you that so long as there is a choice we will not be repeating the experience.,,,Economy Class,,,,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0,no,,

Everything was what one might expect of a low cost carrier so no surprises there. However I missed my first flight due to 'visa check' procedures they require for those who are not EU/EEA citizens. Even though I did not require a visa for either of my destinations their insistence on this was not the real problem however but that they had so few agents working that this process took much longer than the security check on both legs of my journey. So it really spoiled my experience (especially in missing my first flight which then caused me to incur additional charges to get onto the next flight) simply because they did not have enough agents working. Additionally because they made such a fuss over 'checking visas' I would have assumed they would be able to provide UK arrival cards on-board since they would know non EU/EEA citizens need these as I've always done this with any other flight instead of having to fill one out after landing. They however did not have these on the return flight which meant I spent even more time at the UK immigration check simply because they did not have them.,,,Economy Class,,,,3.0,4.0,0.0,,2.0,no,,

I paid extra for priority boarding both to and from Wroclaw. We departed from Cork last Sunday night and all was fine apart from minor delays at the final door prior to leaving the airport to make our way to the plane. On the other hand the service that we received in Wroclaw was an absolute disgrace. Both myself and my friend were the third and fourth in the queue went through the first check in gates to go down to the foyer leading to the Tarmac and plane. The other q passengers then went through their check in procedure. We all were massed in this small foyer for approx 20 mins and then they decided to open the gates and push approx 6 different families with buggies on top of us. Needless to say it was absolute bedlam by the time the doors were finally opened. There was an elderly Polish lady who had also paid for priority boarding who was pushed out of the way with the stampede to get to the plane. They really need to look at your procedures around check in and boarding as I have never experienced anything like this before. I would suggest that people with buggies should be checked in first and that these then should be placed in the foyer. The next passengers to be checked in should be priority passengers as after all they have paid for the privilege of this service! Finally the passengers who are in the alternative queue should then be checked in.

As the next set of passengers were queuing at the foot of the steps we felt compelled to get off. No staff took responsibility for us once we were on the tarmac. Luckily a Stansted Airport employee was passing by the window and saw me struggling down the steps on crutches and rushed to our aid. She was horrified that we had been abandoned and quickly obtained wheelchairs for us both. Herself and a colleague took us all the way to the outside.

At Rhodes we were first to check-in and they took the first 90 cabin bags in the hold. Surely it should be the last? There seems no reason now to take cabin bags at all! The benefit apart from the cost is that you can exit the airport much quicker at your destination. Waiting for cabin bags takes as long as waiting for large luggage.

I use it often and I have never had a problem with Ryanair. Even with hidden fees tickets for me seem cheaper than Aer Lingus. The aircraft are clean but still somewhat dark and gloomy and the seats are uncomfortable horrible on a late-night flights or dawn when you try and catch some sleep however still possible. The snacks and drinks on board are still a reasonable price and the crew are friendly. The toilets are excellent being bright and clean. Ryanair gets the job done.,,,Economy Class,,,,1.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,yes,,
1805,2014-10-05,,United Kingdom,,Ryanair customer review,Flight number FR694 on the 6th of September from Prestwick UK to Ibiza Spain. The majority of passengers onboard this drink fuelled flight were unruly drunken and aggressive towards other passengers despite the best efforts of the 4 onboard cabin crew. Language throughout was absolutely foul. As a grandmother travelling with 2 young infants under the age of four the condition experienced in the cabin were shocking. Passengers were swearing were drinking open duty free were throwing objects from in front and behind us. Safety announcements could not be heard as passengers were playing music from bluetooth devices and the cabin was totally out of control. Cabin crew were very concerned however despite the best efforts to contain behaviour there was no way they could control the passengers. The crew threatened to divert the aircraft to France and also threatened the majority of passengers with the police meeting them on arrival at the destination. The main point is that safety notices were completely ignored myself and my family felt totally unsafe during the flight. My grand-daughters aged two and three have never been exposed to such outrageous language and behaviour - the conditions on this flight were not safe and were not suitable for a family. Access to toilets involved standing for 40 minutes in crowds of alcohol fuelled louts. Many of the passengers boarded the flight inebriated one group drank a litre bottle of duty free vodka onboard the flight whilst throwing coins around the cabin. We are feeling extremely anxious about our return journey.,,,Economy Class,,,,3.0,1.0,0.0,,1.0,no,,
1806,2014-10-05,9,Ireland,,Ryanair customer review,Very short flight from Barcelona to Palma (FR 6362) yet the crew managed to do their inflight service and the usual thing of hawking a few scratch cards. What was more amazing is that the crew were in a good mood seemed happy enough to be there and actually seemed to like each other - they even had the pax laughing! After numerous FR flights with miserable looking crews this was a pleasant surprise. Maybe the new positively is filtering down to the cabin crew? Only downside is the trumpet sound or whatever it was when landing but great all round otherwise.,,,Economy Class,,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,,5.0,yes,,
1807,2014-10-01,,Ireland,,Ryanair customer review,I have used Ryanair for years now sometimes 5 times per year in general and all is good. I booked a flight for my daughter and 2 year old granddaughter. When she left Shannon all was well until her return flight home from Tenerife. 6.30 am she checked in for the free allocation of seats they were allocated separate seats opposite side aisles. My daughter went early to the departures queue and boarded one of the first after priority boarding and explained to one of the crew they told her to take her seats and they would try to change her once they were in the air. I find this quite incredible for a flight to take off with a 2 year old baby sat on her own. Surely the crew have the option to change a free allocated seat but what amazes me more was Ryanair had all details as you have to register a child separately when booking. Why if they want more money for a flight just put the price out in the first instance.,,,Economy Class,,,,1.0,1.0,2.0,,0.0,no,,

Did not expect much but I was quite impressed with them. I work as Cabin Crew so I do know how to travel with a low cost carrier. I paid the extra 10eur for a seat on the first row. Extremely comfortable and thanks to the included priority boarding hassle free experience in the airport. My bag was a bit bigger (the side which was supposed to be just 20cm was slightly larger did not experience any problem). Staff extremely polite and professional both in the airport and in the air. Flight landed 5min early in BVA so absolutely nothing to complain about. I paid 23eur for a flight ticket and got early to my destination on board a brand new Boeing 737 aircraft (the aircraft had been delivered only a week before).

Sat on the plane for an hour or more before being told it could not be fixed. Were not informed that we could have vouchers for snacks found out by chance that by producing the boarding pass at the counter that we were entitled to £3.50 each. When we eventually took off at 10.30 pm we arrived at Malaga to find that our shuttle service had gone. This was now around 2.30 in the morning. Had to take a taxi at an extra cost to us of £100 - eventually arrived at our destination at 3.30 am - not good for two 73 year olds!

1814,2014-09-22,2,United Kingdom,,Ryanair customer review,Travelled on 10/09/14 - having booked airport wheelchair and assistance for boarding to gate and vice versa for departure and both return flight. To my dismay no wheelchair had been arranged at the Dusseldorf Weeze airport. Bus driver unlocked padlock of chained up wheelchairs. Stewards failed to inform arrival airport of my pre-booked requirements. Staff should also insure that passenger take their allocated seats - had a lady whose body posture was extremely intimidating and hostile because she could not get out fast enough caused by her sitting in the wrong seat. Flying back same problem again - staff did not inform Stansted airport of my pre-booked requirements. Was stranded for more than 15 minutes outside the aircraft on the tarmac before porter with wheelchair turned up. I shan't forget the blank expression on the faces of the aircrew staff either which made me feel very uncomfortable I'm sure it can be improved with more staff training and please slow down the food and drink trolleys as no one gets a chance to buy anything at this speed and it might cause an accident.,,,Economy Class,,,,3.0,1.0,0.0,,3.0,no,,

Sometimes a flight can be below standard which usually results in muttering disapproval however my wife and I flew from Manchester to Majorca last week and we were absolutely appalled by both the service but moreover the behaviour of the majority of the other passengers. They consisted mostly of stag groups and hen party groups who prior to boarding had sampled the wares of the departure lounge bars I suspect for several hours the screaming and shouting and rolling around the centre aisle was a vision to behold.

1821,2014-09-17,10,United Kingdom,,Ryanair customer review,I fly Ryanair and easyjet to Malaga from Liverpool every 2 weeks and have done so for 2.5 years. The service from both is good and Ryanair are normally the cheapest. I have had 3 delays due to weather and one diversion to East Midlands last year due to the weather. I do hear complaints every now and then on flights for both airlines the majority by people who are not seasoned travellers and only fly on limited occasions. The complaints were mostly why cant I sit at the front because they see these seats are free but they are told you cant have these seats as the aircraft needs to be balanced. Most accept this others don't and they hold the queue up by arguing. Then you get the guy and his mate who hover around the extra leg room seats to see if they can get one and they block the aisles and hold the queue up. Now that allocated seating is on all aircraft these problems seem to be resolved apart from the odd idiot who says I want to sit next to my mate but we did not get that option when we booked so can you sort it this again holds the queue up. With regards to the aircraft staff yes they have their bad days but that is not surprising as they see the same type of idiots flying in and flying out. The expression you pay peanuts you get monkeys however does not apply to the majority of staff I have come across and the vast majority of regular travellers appreciate the stewards and the service they give.

We had very little money left myself my partner and my 7 year old daughter had to share a meal at the hotel as we could not afford anything else. When we got to the airport Tuesday evening we was told that the pre booked seats we had paid for was no longer ours we was treated like cattle with no apology whatsoever.

1823,2014-09-17,1,Ireland,,Ryanair customer review,Business plus plan: Smoke and Mirrors. I just went on a business trip and took the opportunity of travelling with Ryanair on their new Business plus plan. Just as an aside I fly regularly with Ryanair (no choice) and usually book and pay for all the options so I went for 'all the options' in a package that promised a 'bit' more and cost 70 euros more. The flight was from Dublin to Nice (France). The offering was 1) Flexibility on ticket changes 2) 20kg baggage allowance 3) Fast track airport security 4) Priority boarding and 5) Choose your premium seat. So this was all pretty good and I bought into it all. I did not need to use #1. #2 is standard. #3 I wanted and at Dublin Airport there was a gate for this that put us behind people being let into the fast lane for clearance (no big deal). When it came to the return flight this was not an option. #4 is standard. However at Nice everyone was let through the check in at the same time (there were two queues) and most priority passengers were way to the back of the ensueing melee - all were then herded aboard a couple of busses so no priority. #5 is standard. Bottom Line: Business plus plan is a total fake intended to take more money out of business passengers without giving them anything.,,,Economy Class,,,,1.0,3.0,0.0,,1.0,no,,

On the flight over I ordered a small bottle of Prosecco the flight attendant went for ice and when she returned she knocked over the ice and in an attempt to catch it she knocked the bottle over which spilled over me. She did not apologise until about 15 minutes later and at the time she just picked up the bottle and said it is only a little amount. I had to get up and go to the bathroom to try and soak up some of the wine. Thankfully it was white wine. On our return flight I badly needed to go to the toilet the flight attendant was talking for a while with the co-pilot and finally I had to stand up. I was told from the toilet to sit down I was again told to sit as the co-pilot had to use the bathroom which he did however when he came out they again continued talking. I again stood up to be told sit again but this time she then indicated I use the rear toilet as the captain was to use the front facility also. (I was in row 9). As I approached the rear toilet the flight attendant there told me to go back to my seat I had to sit down the fasten your seatbelt sign was on I tried to explain and eventually stressed I had to use the toilet “now”. Then the attendant from the front called the rear and said to let me use the toilet which I did. The was very stressful especially in front of all the other people on board I do understand the need for safety on board a plane however the f act the staff have extended conversations amongst themselves as opposed to taking care of their paying clients speaks volumes.

We landed just before 10.45 10 mins early. Yet again no fanfare but a little announcement about there low fares and the fact they have a 90% punctuality record. Overall they just get you there on time which is really all that travel is so I would recommend them if you are on a budget or Stansted is your local airport.,,,Economy Class,,,,2.0,2.0,2.0,,4.0,yes,,

1845,2014-08-28,,United Kingdom,,Ryanair customer review,My journey from Stansted to Ibiza was ruined by drunken stag party members whose behaviour was completely disregarded by the air crew. It was evident from the beginning when the crew did a half-hearted safety demonstration that no-one had authority to run this flight. Passengers became increasingly distressed as the stag party shouted and swore aggressively ran up and down the aisles and openly drank from bottles of vodka while standing behind Ryanair staff. The crew evidently avoided eye contact no public announcements were made to warn them of the consequences and when I complained that the situation wasn't being managed staff simply ignored me. Although they did drag their feet bringing the trolley down the aisle they eventually served these men even more alcohol. This was a potentially very dangerous situation. On landing all of the men (aside from one who was incoherent and staggering) behaved perfectly properly as they exited through security to avoid arrest which suggests that they would have responded to warnings about their conduct during the flight.,,,Economy Class,,,,2.0,1.0,2.0,,1.0,no,,

1847,2014-08-26,6,United Kingdom,,Ryanair customer review,We have flown Ryanair many times without problems. If you know what to expect then you wont get disappointed. However upon arriving at East Midlands airport for our flight to Tenerife South recently with plenty of time to spare we found that there were 12 flights departing at roughly the same time. 12 flights of people that needed to check in and clear security before boarding. It seems that Ryanair just bung everyone together regardless of which flight you are on Some people were panicking as their flight was taking off soon and were stuck at check in when asked to jump the queue were told they would have to wait like everyone else! It took us 2 hours to get through check in and clear security. Queues were snaked round the airport (although admittedly this is not Ryanair's fault!) but a better system needs put in place for Ryanair check in. We managed to get to the boarding gates just in time albeit at the end of the queue. There we were kept waiting for 20 minutes as staff now needed hand luggage to put on the hold. The staff member was very aggressive and rude to us trying to grab our bags to put in the hold we told her that we needed the bags for inflight and one contained valuables that we wanted to keep with us. She tried to snatch my husbands backpack from his back and took my daughters small suitcase from her before I took it back. We eventually offered one bag but I had to remove everything that was needed and carry it in my hands she wouldn't even give us a carrier bag. She went up and down the last remaining passengers trying to grab peoples hand luggage but as nobody else would offer a bag she came back to us telling us she needed our bags we refused but She wasn't having any of it and barked at us we didn't have a choice as we were at the end of the queue and if we didn't put our hand luggage in the hold we would be fined £60. Her attitude was appalling and if she'd have asked politely we may have tried our best to accommodate her request. She wouldn't let the last people through the departure gate thus holding up the flight until she had the bags But no way were we giving up our remaining (small) bags. We eventually got on the bus to the plane and on the flight there we sat for another 20 minutes before actually taking off! It was never made clear that only the first 60 passengers were guaranteed to take their hand luggage. Yet on our return flight home everything was smooth queues moved quickly and staff were very pleasant helpful and polite. We packed our bags accordingly and offered our hand luggage for the hold. We fly Ryanair because it is cheap but cheap doesn't mean but I expect to be spoken to like dirt from someone's shoe!,,,Economy Class,,,,2.0,2.0,2.0,,4.0,yes,,

However on balance it was better than expected. Friendly flight attendants and apologies about the slight delay on departure. There was enough leg room for my liking even being a male of average height and the aircraft was clean. The only thing I would do is remove the garish yellow. But that's a matter of taste. Ultimately exceeded my expectations so kudos to Ryanair. I think the key is to stick to the rules which have been relaxed slightly recently and you'll be just fine.

1850,2014-08-26,5,United Kingdom,,Ryanair customer review,I use Ryanair regularly flying from Dublin to the Netherlands. You get what you pay for. Fast boarding a flight with reasonable service and quickly into the terminal once the plane has arrived. The staff aren't particularly friendly and clearly look as if they are under pressure for the entire flight. Upon reaching the gate the flight attendants have often told passengers that they only have 20 minutes to get the plane turned around and to get off quickly once the doors are opened. This often leads to a push when getting off. To avoid this I remain seated until people have started getting off. Because of the short turn around time it isn't unusual to find some else's rubbish in your seat pocket however flight attendants do go round with a rubbish bag before the end of the flight so it's caused by inconsiderate passengers rather than the airline. Overall if you just want to get there on time and you are not concerned about the service fly Ryanair.,,,Economy Class,,,,2.0,1.0,0.0,,4.0,no,,

After being in the queue for roughly 30 mins a staff member called 5 flights to a separate desk to check in we did this which seemed to take an age. Finally we got our baggage in and we get to the gate and board the plane and were met by another massive queue through security. Ran towards the gate had to get on a train to the gate. When we finally got to the gate the flight had gone 10 very bemused passengers had also missed the flight. we all got directed to customer services. We were taken to the wrong desk and queued for 30 mins then got taken to the right desk. Another huge queue. When we got to the front the staff just said next flight is Tuesday at a cost of £440.

The return flight a few days after was quite badly delayed we were probably in the air about 30 minutes after we should have left Dublin. We did board and got underway after a while but there was the substantial delay (which went without explanation) and then they had the audacity to start flogging superfluous amounts of miscellaneous tat. After spending an hour in a queue in Dublin T1 I don't want perfume or scratch cards I want quiet!

By the time your in the last cattle call line it's ignored and not enforced. Seats do not recline there are ads on the overhead bins and seat backs.

The aircrew were helpful and cheerful and although we were late leaving by 30 minutes could not have served us any better. It was very busy at Mallorca airport on our departure and we had a bit of a wait in the queue but this was because most people had not checked the weight of their luggage so were re-packing.

The stewardess immediately apologised and offered me an extra 10% off perfumes which I did not use. Also in the row behind us was three kids (in three seats with no adults) one young child proceeded to kick my partners chair rather violently whilst the parents were relaxing with headphones on unaware to their child's misbehaviour again a quick word to the stewardess and an adult was moved beside the children and the mischief stopped.

1862,2014-08-20,,United Kingdom,,Ryanair customer review,This airline continues to show it has no interest in customer service or staff training. Only bottom line. After arriving at Stansted 3 hours before the flight was due to depart we arrived at the boarding gate during final flight call. Why? Because of the throng of people Ryanair euphemistically call a queue attempting to check- in their bags at their bag-drops manned by the Ryanair Gestapo. It appears these rude unhelpful staff's main training was on extracting extra cash wherever it is physically possible. To watch so many people removing items from hold bags only to add them to their cabin luggage is farcical. Or would be if it wasn't so sad. In my own case my bag was 5kg under and my travelling partner's was nearly 1kg over. No problem you would think there is still a net difference of -4kg. But no as the tickets weren't booked on the same reference number we were deemed to be travelling separately. Even though we had booked seat numbers next to each other and paid the extra we were still flying separately according to the misery behind the counter. Ok so it's no real effort to undo her bag remove a few bits and put them into the bag you are going to take into the cabin with you. But multiply that with the amount of people doing the same and you soon end up with massive queues. And both bags are going onto the plane anyway!

So in effect you are being charged for having your bag with you. I am a regular traveller so don't take hold luggage to avoid the waiting at the destination.

My only gripe is that I had booked a Shannon-Nantes flight and Hertz car hire in January. Ryanair cancelled the Nantes fight in May offering a flight to Poitiers or money back. Transfer went very smoothly. However Hertz told me that they did not have an office in Poitiers and my only option was to cancel which I did only to be charged a 50 euro cancellation fee even though I had booked through Ryanair.

No constant announcements for buying this and that anymore. Leg room stays a problem though as they press 198 passengers into a Boeing 737-800. Wouldn't bear a FR-flight longer than two hours. All in all a decent experience for less than 200 euro rtn for two including bag priority boarding - worked well but isn't really necessary anymore with allocated seating - and reserved seat.

On arriving at Malta airport 2 hours 20 minutes before my flight a particularly grumpy Ryanair agent took up 10 minutes of my time telling me I was too late and should have done this in Malta (How exactly if there are no internet cafes and you do not stay in a hotel?) before finally pointing me towards the computer where I could do this. This touchscreen computer was slow and unresponsive and so I was 2 minutes late to meet the 2 hour deadline because of this woman's complete lack of customer service. An EUR 140 fee and a horrible stressful end to the holiday. What gets me is that I knew I had to print the boarding pass off 2 hours before and made a fair effort to do so leaving 20 minutes to do this on arrival at the airport. I noticed Lufthansa had dedicated machines clearly visible for this purpose. I had to beg this woman to tell me where was the Ryan Air machine before she pointed it out to me all the while telling me I was too late etc when I still had time. However reading other reviews it looks as if even if I had been at the airport much earlier that the fee might still have been charged.

Arrived 2 hours before the flight and were met with chaos as my niece (on same flight with us) who had come to visit needed to drop off her suitcase (also already checked-in online). Passengers of numerous flights had all been lumped together into one disorientated heap of people with check-in operating at slow pace. The usual clue as to the destination above the relevant individual check-in desks was not there and was replaced by one single queue/lump of chaos. One distraught couple told me that they had already been queuing for 40 minutes at the wrong Ryanair desk round the corner. I asked a passing Ryanair staff if we were in the right queue (although it was hard to describe it as such) and pointed out that our flight was about to close. He confirmed we were. 15 minutes later he asked passengers for the Bremen flight to come forward. Our flight had already closed whilst at security which was as chaotic. Mercifully the flight was late taking off. I have never experienced in all my years of travelling to all the continents on the globe such chaos stress and anxiety. There was nothing leisurely about this trip. We had to run (it was very hot) all the way through corridors and shops only to be met by a train (not a gate) taking us to the gates. We were lucky that our gate was in the thirties not seventies as we would have missed our flight for sure. In the end we arrived breathless hot and sweating in front of another lump/queue of passengers with just enough time to use the toilet. I should also mention that the word priority on your check-in paper does not mean a thing.

Security took 27 mins. Unacceptable. Then we waited for around for 90 mins before flight was called and we went to gate 44 immediately. As being called 40 mins before and getting to gate 35 mins before we thought the plane would be there in 10 mins. It wasn't and was there no earlier than 25 mins of waiting at the gate. We were rushed on to the steps to Tarmac whist pax where deboarding and we where on it around 3 mins before our scheduled departure time. We where off 15 mins behind schedule. The flight was smooth and fine. I had a Pepsi and just looked out of the window no IFE or food. We sat in row 5 and had priority boarding. The aircraft landed 10 mins early and we had the usual fanfare. We where de boarded quickly and went straight through to meet relatives who have a 2nd home and took our bags with them. La Rochelle to Stansted. We got there 2 hours 15 mins before flight and we went through security. Relatives driving back took bags with them. There is 1 duty free shop and a cafe. There where 2 aircraft departing at same time and being the first in the lounge gets us a seat. (La Rochelle gets overcrowded). The aircraft got in 10 mins early but the other Brussels flight was late. Boarding began 10 mins before departure and we where off just after the Brussels 15 mins behind. The flight was ok. My seat was dirty and had gum under the seat in front. Again row 5 and priority boarding.

I see that the staff have new marching orders and that intimidation is no longer the order of the day. This new more normal”attitude is already being noticed. Passengers are already taking liberties with hand luggage it will probably not be long before a new clampdown” will be enforced and unpleasant situations will once again be splattered all over the review sites. I made sure I had ticked all the boxes and weighed in before travelling this time. My previous experience has made me paranoid”about using this airline. I would have preferred not to have used Ryanair. They offered the best price for the trip and as money is tight I was compelled to take the risk. We can remain optimistic and hope they carry on in this manner. Perhaps in 3 to 5 years they will have a positive reputation. I still have reservations Ryanair inflicted such needless blow to my family that I am afraid to say it will never be forgiven.

I enquired what was the minimum number she could help? Priority booked and seats reserved only to be herded from one queue at the gate to the next queue at the entrance of the air bridge then on to the queue at the aircraft doorway 20 minutes standing during intense summer heat. Not the sort of treatment to subject an expectant mother to. Not one member of staff took the care or comfort of this pregnant lady into account.

1889,2014-07-27,,United Kingdom,,Ryanair customer review,Flight FR 2132 - an number I will never forget. 2nd time with Ryanair and first time although no real problems felt like we were treated as second class citizens so vowed never to book with them again. However family holiday to Lanzarote and the only people flying out in the morning (so we arrive before lunch) was Ryanair. So I hesitantly booked (even though it was no cheaper than the other airlines). First came the con where you can no longer print your boarding passes (unless you have paid the extra for allocated seating) until 14 days before you return date. As this was a 2 week holiday I was already at the airport catching my flight out so had to pay for allocated seating. This was just a snippet of what was to come. The flight out was cattle market heaven but quite uneventful so consoled myself with the fact that I had done the right thing and would have an extra half day holiday by flying out early. The flight home was the nightmare we were called to our gate then the gate changed twice so the long queue of people were already irate when there was a general murmur around the crowd. This was when the first person had received a text to say the flight had been delayed due to technical issues and we had a delay of over 5 hours. Not told anything by the staff on the ground the whole airport became Chinese whispers. In total I had 4 texts from Ryanair delaying the flight eventually by 12 hours. We did not arrive home until 5am. I feel like I now need another holiday after spending 15 hours in a very hot uncomfortable airport and then a further 4 hour flight home.,,,Economy Class,,,,2.0,1.0,3.0,,3.0,no,,

Today however I was waiting to board the flight at Skavsta Airport when then airport staff start walking along the line of people waiting and randomly telling passengers the flight was full and the had to put their hand luggage in the main hold. When I pointed out that I had some breakable goods in my bag I was told that if I was that worried I should had been in the queue earlier. As it happened There were about 10 people in the non-priority queue ahead of me. Also my travel companion was at the end of the queue but was allowed to take his bag same size as mine on board without problems. There was no logic at all. TO me it seems like the only way to guarantee that you can bring your hand luggage on board is to pay the ""priority boarding"" fee.

1894,2014-07-17,8,United Kingdom,,Ryanair customer review,Having been put off using Ryanair about 4 years ago I took a flight from Bristol to Girona and return early July 2014. I was well aware of all the pitfalls and extra charges and then made the mistake of mis-spelling my own first name. I thought 'here we go' especially as I couldn't get through on the phone even the £1.09 a minute line. Then I stumbled upon their 'live chat' facility got connected within 2 minutes and had the name corrected. They emailed me a revised confirmation. Of the flights - well the pre-allocated seats are a great improvement - saves that awful scramble on board with the FAs screaming 'if you don't sit down we'll lose our flight slot' and passengers coming to blows. The boarding pass saying front or rear of the plane is sensible. Unlike previous flights (which was what finally put me off Ryanair) there were no cases either at BRS or GRO of passengers being harassed having their luggage weighed or measured or any sign of people being charged for things. Most notably I didn't hear any passengers grumbling about anything. So the simple impression of just 2 flights is that you get what you pay for on-time clean planes and a vast improvement from 4 (plus) years ago. Whether I want to brave a STN flight is debatable but I need to fly home later in the year and I won't be too worried.,,,Economy Class,,,,3.0,4.0,0.0,,5.0,yes,,

The rep at the counter all of a sudden did not speak English or Spanish was rude and started to roll her eyes. We paid the additional charge and went back to check our luggage. We then were told there were more charges for our bag (under weight) that were not included apparently. We paid the extra fees and finally were told we could get in line. We proceeded to get in line which was a huge disaster and with no logic or system in place or completely poorly executed and took 2 hours. The lines began to severely back up they began shifting customers back and forth between lines and ultimately the plane had to leave late. Once on the plane the conditions and cleanliness of the plane were noticeably lacking and even a few pieces were broken. Refreshments were offered at unreasonable prices. The pilot must have been new because the entire flight was filled with drastic turns turbulence and ultimately. We couldn't wait to get off the plane.

I needed to make it back to Shannon for a trans-atlantic flight the following afternoon so they saved my holiday from being cancelled. This along with the various upgrades to their service in the past 12 months (additional carry on bag reserved seating etc) have made Ryanair my choice of airline when flying from London. Customer service is dramatically improving in my opinion and as long as you know how they operate and how the pricing structure works then there shouldn't be any issues when flying with them.

Boarding was very smooth and the children received special attention from a friendly crew member. Plane landed on time in Rome. Return was about the same. I fly regularly with Ryanair and I never had any problems. Delays are hardly the mistake of the airline but of the airport and the airport handling so you cannot blame them for that. Also people flying with Ryanair don't want to pay much for their tickets but they complain about the people paying the extras like priority boarding. Some passengers not paying for the extras were complaining why we could get on first! Also if you preselect your seat with a small extra you can print your boarding pass (also for the return flight) at home. Even with all the extras Ryanair was the cheapest solution. So to be frankly not Ryanair is the problem but some people flying with Ryanair are. Ryanair is very clear about their rules and I really don't understand why people don't obbey them?

We arrived at the airport 2.5 hours before our flight. We were told that all boarding passes had to be printed or it was 70 euros per person. There were 4 of us so this was a hefty fee. I saw others approaching the counter to check in with their phones. I asked about this and they said it had to be done 2 hours ahead of the flight and it was too late. 90% of the people that approached the counter had to pay additional fees. We also paid ahead for 2 bags. 4 of us ere traveling so we knew we would have that much. They said that only one bag showed on their side of the reservation so we needed to pay for the other bag. I had an email confirming 2 bags and they said they couldn't go by that.,,,Economy Class,,,,3.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,no,,

Not much space to move around in the plane itself but acceptable for short haul flights. One disadvantage - everything costs money. I'm surprised they still don't charge for bathroom trips. Of course you can only expect so much from a low price airline which is the main advantage. Another thing is the flight attendants trying to sell lottery tickets and calendars that is rather unprofessional feels like you're in a market or someplace similar.

1919,2014-06-23,2,United Kingdom,,Ryanair customer review,"If anyone is every considering flying with Ryanair ensure you know exactly what experience you are signing up for when you book your ticket. We went return from Luton to Marrakech and would not do this journey with them again. In fact we'd only think about it for very short flights for weekend breaks and to be honest that would be pretty desperate. Where to start? They may offer cheaper ""upfront"" costs but add-ons are extortionate. The fact you cannot print off your return boarding pass within 7 days of your return flight is just a way to con people out of the money (£10 per person) to advance purchase a designated seat. After all who wants to gallivant around an unfamiliar foreign city looking for an internet cafe that may or may not have a printer. The queuing is still a scrum even though they have finally realised that assigning people seats will stop the kind of behaviour they and their ilk were responsible for creating. On the flight the whole experience is stuffy cramped and bad tempered. The hard-sell starts instantly and continues through the whole flight. The claustrophobic atmosphere is taken further by the fact that some aisles didn't even have windows! They couldn't even be bothered to give out landing cards either which just prolonged the bad experience at the airport. I reckon that after all the add-ons it would have been cheaper to fly with BA. Although BA are pretty woeful 3.5 hours on a Ryanair flight is far too much.",,,Economy Class,,,,1.0,3.0,1.0,,1.0,no,,
1920,2014-06-23,,United Kingdom,,Ryanair customer review,22/6/2014. Flying from Stansted to Treviso Venice for 7 days holiday we were fine on our outward journey as we had been able to check-in and print off the boarding passes however the system would allow us to do the same for our return at that point in time. Where we were staying we had no access to a computer or printer but assumed perhaps foolishly that at Treviso airport they would have the same system as they do in Stansted and we would be able to check-in and print off at their machines for a nominal fee. How wrong we were. We arrived well before the 2 hour time scale but ended having to pay additional 140 Euros! Money making at its worse I feel very sorry for the staff at the check in desks whilst we were there I saw at least another 2 people who were in the same position as we were. It wasn't until I got home I saw the email from Ryanair advising of the additional costs. I received a text message at 23.00 the night before our departure at 9.50 reminding us we needed to check-in and print off the boarding card if they had notified me in this text of the astronomical charge awaiting us at the airport we would have search around the entire city of Venice for someone to assist us but it wasn't included!

While on the plane a flight attendant removed my bag from the overhead in order to put in someone else's bag. He then tried to fit mine which contained a laptop Ipad and Kindle into a separate overhead by cramming it in. I finally had to yell at him to stop to which he complained my bag was too large to fit.

So we were hoping that it will be an easy check in since we came two hours early. We were told at the airport that we should have checked in online and that the payment was forfeited so we had to pay again for the same flight. In addition we had to pay 40 Euros each for our luggage since only 2 small carry ons were allowed. Since we had to go on that flight we had no recourse but to give in.

1925,2014-06-18,1,United Kingdom,,Ryanair customer review,Flew Manchester-Gran Canaria. Good flight times and got baggage quickly. Attempting to print off the boarding pass scam was painful to say the least. In the UK the site kept crashing and took the best part of a day to achieve the process only to have to repeat this in our holiday destination. When at Manchester airport it was displayed that boarding for our flight was in 5 minutes this continued for about 25 minutes with no updates. We were then requested to proceed to boarding that I can only explain as a cattle market. We were then left to wait in the queue for the best part of another 45 minutes. Consequently our flight was delayed by well over an hour with no explanation or apology. Whilst on the flight to Gran Canaria the seat belt sign light was displayed intermittently for long periods with no evidence of turbulence or explanation. Being 2 adults we could manage this but we had to feel for the passengers with young children who desperately wanted the toilet. Baggage - the allowance is 15 kilos for hold luggage and 10 for hand luggage. When we flew out from Manchester they counted hand luggage in our allowance. On return from Gran Canaria they decided that hold luggage should only be 15 kilos. Our hold luggage weighed exactly the same as it did at Manchester and we did not have hand luggage but were told that it would cost us 70 euros to pay the excess. Having very little hand luggage facilities available we had to empty our case to avoid the excess charge. Admittedly we should have read the small print but one would question why this was not highlighted in Manchester and came to light in Gran Canaria on our return. Overall it may be a budget airline but really not worth the hassle.,,,Economy Class,,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,no,,

Its not so much the delay that's the problem it is the total lack of communication or an apology for the late running. We were asked to queue up for boarding and stood there for over an hour with no communication. Worse was to follow. On the following Saturday we were booked on the 22.00 flight out of Pisa for Stansted. Again no communication or apologies were forthcoming from Ryanair. 150 minutes after the flight should have left we were told it was cancelled - no apology again. We were not offered any refreshment during this three hours. They then booked the passengers a hotel but had only a mini bus to start with to take 16 passengers a time randomly selected by Ryanair staff. We eventually arrived at the hotel at 03.00 but had to be up for an 07.00 departure from the hotel. No food or drinks were offered by Ryanair. No staff were available at Pisa airport to speak to or to hand out vouchers. The service was shabby at best. No apologies poor communication no-one to talk too and no refreshment vouchers either.

We were just running to the gate and airline crew just shut the gate on us (the flight was still open and they refused to take us in).

1957,2014-05-25,2,United Kingdom,,Ryanair customer review,Use of Ryanair is generally a last resort. Flight last Friday from Treviso to Bristol was due to take off at 15:20 but about 30mins beforehand a small storm arrived with torrential rain and lightning meant there was likely to be some delay. However passengers were still gathered around the very small and enclosed gate area as normal and only at departure time was the board updated to show an hour delay. Everyone including several disabled passengers in wheelchairs stayed expecting aircraft arrival and loading as indicated. The storm had passed and other aircraft were moving. No further updates were given and an hour later a further hour delay was updated on the gate display. With no seating for most passengers no refreshments and no information people were becoming unhappy especially as another delayed flight were packed into the same space. When the third hour delay was put up on the display it was accompanied by advice notices for passengers advising of EU travel rights! When the plane eventually arrived just before the third hour of delay and passengers allowed to board the crew were more concerned with making sure we were aware they were due to be off duty soon - no word of any apology for delay from anyone. Part way into the flight back it was then announced the crew was at their limit of allowed flight time and we would be diverted into Brussels for a new crew to board. On landing no crew but another hour wait for them to be roused from homes to take over the flight. Why the operations staff did not allow for this originally is not known!

I'm usually a very easy going person but Ryanair make my blood boil! They changed my flight time by more than 8 hours meaning that I would lose a day on my holiday I applied for a refund as did my three other friends for the coming home flight (We rebooked another coming home flight for a few days later with Ryanair) All of my friends got their refund however Ryanair refused to give me mine! They said that I cannot just refund one leg of the journey. Eventually they said they would refund it 3 months later and I'm still waiting for money to be put back into my account.

Cabin crew worked hard seats were not too uncomfortable. By following the rules we purchased and paid nothing additional - hence it was great value. The new seven day check-in rule is a bit of a pain because it applies for each leg of the trip separately. So (seven days in advance) we had to check in for the flight out on the 12th May and for the flight back on the 14th.

Placed a booking Ryanair changed the rules between the time I placed my booking and date of flying which meant they expect me to receive return flight boarding cards by email whilst on holiday and then try to get the hotel to print them out for me.

We checked and confirmed the flight status on the Ryanair website the night before the flight. We got an email from Ryanair a few hours before departure saying the flight had been cancelled without stating any reason whatsoever. We tried calling the Ryanair hotline to no avail. We checked the Ryanair website and called Bergamo airport to check if there were other Ryanair flights to Budapest as we had a pre-paid rooms that night in a Budapest hotel and definitely had to be there the next morning a the very latest. There were no flights on the same day or the following day from any Milan airport. We had to commute to Milan Malpensa to buy expensive alternate flights to Budapest with an overnight connection at Warsaw. Ryanair is an absolute nightmare of an airline. An utter waste of time and money and the absolute pits in customer service. We will never book it again.

Overall not too bad I guess for a budget airline but the new introduction of the 7 day boarding pass malarkey meant we were stung on the return flight for 70 euros. As this is on the return flight we had obviously spent up and had to contact one of the groups husbands to ask if we cold charge to his credit card to get us home. At no point was this new procedure explained to us (and yes I appreciate it is probably in the very small print but if you are a regular flyer with Ryanair (which the girl who booked was) you would expect something like this to at least be mentioned when you book) and I can in no way begin to fathom how they can justify 70 euros. It is simple case of robbery and Ryanair should be ashamed of themselves. We were by no means the only people caught out with this phenomenal fee and it certainly feels like you are being held to ransom. Another peev was that when we boarded some people had to put their hand luggage in the checked in luggage area as we were told there was no room in the above holders - lie! They were nearly empty. Because of the unjustifiable boarding pass scam I will certainly never book a Ryanair flight of my own accord and I will be telling anyone who chooses to to think before flying Ryanair.,,,Economy Class,,,,3.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,no,,

In my experience when I was leaving from Birmingham for Barcelona I was requested to put my cabin luggage into the sizer without reminding. Since my luggage which its design is flexible and there are two rows of zippers at that moment it was not suitable for the sizer. I said I can try to make it smaller but there were three staff crowed to me and threatened me they didn't have time to let me organise my items and charge me the penalty immediately. Their attitudes were like robbers and I didn't have any options then because there was nobody beside me. Actually when I returned from Barcelona the same luggage and there were even more items inside but I've used a belt to tie it up. Therefore the length is much less than 20 cm and it perfectly fit the sizer. Due to the delayed flight every passenger was on board without any checking size of their baggage when I left form Barcelona for Birmingham I've also noticed that most of the suitcases were much larger than me but nobody was requested for penalty. I understand terms and conditions of Ryanair in advance. But what a shame the attitude of Ryanair’staff made is unpleasant and 50 pound is not a small fee for me. How come they charged it without any warning (If I could have one more minute to organise my suitcase.) before boarding especially originally I've been tagged the yellow label in the queue however they changed their mind and enforced me when there were no other customers at the boarding gate.

If you pay 10 euros a seat extra for allocated seats! Beware folks it does not say anything about this until after have made the original booking. So this now means that I will have to find an internet cafeé whilst on holiday or pay 70 euros for each boarding pass. What a scam. Just cannot understand Ryanair on this one.

People moaning about not being able to print boarding passes or check in for more than a week in advance should book reserved seating on the aircraft this allows you to check in and print boarding passes for the following 30 days!

I shall be taking a sandwich onto the flight which will saved me paying £6 for a tasteless one from Ryanair I'll even take a soft drink on board.

At the check-in counter we were told EURO 70 per person would be charged if no boarding pass was presented. We could not believe it in the first instance but later were confirmed by his duty manager. We do not believe that EURO 70 for printing a boarding pass is justifiable by any standard. It is in fact more than the airfare itself and more than the fee for an extra luggage (EURO 60). While we accept the error we made the punishment was well beyond anyone's imagination hence it is not reasonable and not justifiable. We felt like being robbed on highway with no way to escape. And we still do. We must point out that the check-in gentleman was kind enough to show us a self-serving Internet kiosk/access point where printing was available. Unfortunately after tried on two computers with loss of a total of EURO 20 worth of coins and notes we went back to the counter and tried to request for printing at a fair and reasonable cost. The second complaint is about the way in which the duty manager a lady handled our request for help. She was arrogant in our view. Having heard of our explanation she showed no sympathy but said it was the company policy and we either pay or do not fly today.

All other airlines allow you to print all boarding cards for your entire journey when you check-in online so can't understand why Ryanair don't. It should not be allowed. They lure you in with a cheap flight cost and charge you for everything else. I was really pleased when they announced they would have allocated seating on all flights which is much easier for those of us travelling with children so this should make it even easier to allocate a seat on return flight instead of making us customers with families having to pay at the airport for boarding cards.

2004,2014-04-22,4,United Kingdom,,Ryanair customer review,I have flown with Ryanair many times over the past 6 years and I have just two wishes. Firstly that they would stop being secretive about their latest scam and secondly if they continue to fly to Valencia they consider not changing flight details with such short notice. In March I booked some flights home from Alicante having read in their terms and conditions that they were changing the 14 day check in online to 30 days from April. However nowhere did it mention that they would be charging for the privilege or I most definitely would have booked easyjet who have had the free 30 day check in for sometime. In relation to Valencia flights they have two scheduled flights a week. In the past after disagreement with Valencia they just cancelled the whole route so I was pleased it recommenced even if it was from Manchester. They have now had to push the Monday flight back by half an hour and have given me 3 weeks notice of the change. It now lands at 11pm. Now that doesn't seem like a lot but unfortunately it has quite an impact cost wise as the majority of the car hire firms in Valencia close at 11 and therefore charge you 30-40 euros to open later. Sadly I'll have to now give up on Ryanair just when I think they were really trying hard. I have always followed the rules and never been disappointed with them to be honest you get what you pay for but I'm finally getting to old to try and stay ahead of their next money making change and 7 days check in is ridiculous so it's back to Easyjet.,,,Economy Class,,,,2.0,3.0,2.0,,3.0,no,,

We asked where we could get one and he sent us back to a young fellow that asked us if we were told that there was a fee obviously the older ""bully"" left it up to the young fellow to break the news of the seventy pound fee. To add insult to injury on our return journey when we passed over our boarding passes that our hotel printed for us they were ripped in half by the airline staff.

2015,2014-04-14,5,United Kingdom,,Ryanair customer review,East Midlands to Tenerife 6th April FR3152. Returned 11th April FR3153. It's great to see that they are finally trying to improve customer service and it was definitely better on the way out. Having allocated seating now is much better although it was not clear when I booked that seats are allocated free at online check in so I unnecessarily paid £40 to do this in advance. Also what on earth is going on with the 'only the first 90 bags' can stay in the cabin idea? Great that you can now take a small bag (handbag laptop bag etc) and put it under your seat. However only the first 90 passengers are allowed to take a correctly sized and weighted wheeled case on board. At Tenerife they decided that everyone had to do this before they got on the plane and it was chaos with people trying to work out what they needed to take out. Strange also that they only pick on wheeled cases even small ones. My partner had a rucksack the contents of which were about the same weight as mine yet my bag was tagged for the hold. By the time I'd taken out all the valuables - camera iPad Kindle etc there was very little left in it. Also there was plenty of empty space on the overhead compartments once we got onboard. All completely pointless. I do think they are trying but they really don't think these things all the way through! All that is going to happen is that people's 2nd bags are gradually going to get larger and larger and there will be the same old rows at check in and the gate as there have always been! Other than that it's pretty good value for money I guess although I agree with other comments about flights times. Lots of them get into Stansted too late for the last trains which prevents me booking with them. Oh and the seats not reclining and no pocket for belongings continues to be tedious.

Assigned seating is a nice new addition though boarding leaves much to be desired - flight departed 20 minutes late due the slightly slow boarding process which prompted some passengers to buy overpriced priority boarding from Ryanair staff hanging around the gate.

Last night I was ripped off for 70 Euros which was actually the price of my ticket just because I didn't check-in online! It was my first time with this airline and there was nothing mentioned when they sent the e-ticket they took advantage of the little T&C that they claim to have put somewhere on their website. Staff were rude and ready to fight.,,,Economy Class,,,,2.0,1.0,0.0,,1.0,no,,

After sitting on the runway for approx. 50 minutes we then had to wait for water and for re-fuel. Finally we took off to Tenerife. On landing at Tenerife Sur the captain aborted the initial landing and escalated back into the sky to attempt a second landing.

There were quite a few people not happy with the situation but the crew just said they had nothing for sale. No inflight magazines were handed out so when they came with the duty free sales not much was sold as no one knew what was for sale.

The pros are Ryanair is a very cheap airline to fly with it usually gets you to your destination 20 mins earlier before scheduled time when you land there is a fanfare sound which is quite funny and the staff are helpful because I had asked for a sick bag and got one right away. Cons are the seats are not comfy at all the staff are arrogant the leg room is very limited the food is expensive and when you board the aircraft it has a very weird strong smell.

The flight was due to take off at 10.30am then it was delayed 6 hours without any explanation to 4.30pm and has just been extended again to 6.30pm with a pre warning that that is just estimated. The reason apparently is staffing issues. At this rate he says he wouldn't be surprised if he's in the airport all night. Also after leaving the passengers in the dark for most of the day they were told if they wanted to book a flight with a different airline they would have to pay again and claim back.

A male steward took Ryanair's poor customer service to a new low - he was extremely rude bad humoured and swore in front of my 11 year old daughter. Additionally Ryanair's new seat allocation policy appears to be at the expense of carrying on your hand luggage if your bag is not in the first 90 bags on board.

You can still check in up to 15 days before the flight without having to pay for an allocated seat despite what they say. In fact if you are crafty you can actually choose your seat free of charge by doing the following: click on 'Choose a Seat' check which ones have already been allocated knowing that they allocate the seats in alternate rows front and back starting either side of the overwing exit rows. If you are happy with the next available seat then exit this page and click on 'Do not Choose Seat' and you will get that seat.

2054,2014-02-25,2,United Kingdom,,Ryanair customer review,Feb 14 MAN-Paphos. This is the most budget airline I have come across I became paranoid about the weight of my luggage! Thankfully we were within the guidelines however on arrival to the gate (2 Ryanair) employees were waiting to pounce scrutinising everyone's hand luggage and asking them to place their cabin bags in the frame. Lucky for us we were OK but numerous passengers who 'could not fit' theirs were made to pay £50 which were then put in the hold. Why did the check in staff not ask to weigh their cabin bags at check in - in my opinion this is the way they make an extra £50 per passenger - some cheap flight for these unfortunate people (students) many of whom were going home for half term and short of money to begin with - for me never again.

However I've just noticed that I can only check in online 7 days before the flights unless I buy a pre-allocated seat. Because of my flight times this means I will have to find a place to print out my boarding pass while away.

First of all a flight 2 weeks in advance from the booking date for £9.99 one way can not be denied this is a brilliant price for an on-time flight on a virtually brand new 737-800. The one gripe I'd have is the allocated seating (something that most airlines use effectively). As a frequent FR traveller I pick the same seat every time unfortunately the common sense of booking and then finding your seat seems to have evaded some people as it turned into some chaos - so I'd advise to still get on the aircraft towards the front. Other than that I'm extremely happy to fly Ryanair again and again as the on-time no-frills cheap flights will always be too good to turn down!

This leaves us with the migrane inducing yellow the bright cabin lights and the constant procession of scratchcard sales and frankly annoying announcements about the still overpriced microwave food to moan about. They seem to have at least stopped the irritating soft drink adverts on replay. I guess Ryanair are an option if they are flying where you want to actually go but my own conclusion - as a relatively frequent flyer - is that there is no point in saving a little bit of money if it costs you a lot of time and hassle which on this trip it still did.,,,Economy Class,,,,2.0,3.0,0.0,,5.0,yes,,

On board is a joke leg room and general scope of the seating is ridiculous. All cabin crew were rude and only wanted to sell things. We heard about the seat belt signs coming on for turbulence just before the trolleys come out and sure enough this happened twice on the way out and back apparently an old Ryanair trick. Return check in at Tenerife was ridiculous 5 Ryanair flights being checked in at one time through 3 desks that's nearly 700 passengers. No Ryanair staff on duty and no one is interested in what you have to say. Usual stampede for seats together again why should we pay for that privilege? Its standard with everyone else.

I fly quite a few times a year but this was my first time with Ryanair so I was interested to compare. I have to say if you follow the rules that are made very clear to you well before departure you will have no problems. There were a few people who hadn't printed boarding passes or their cases were far too big for the cabin and they were moaning about being charged to check them in etc. Yes the fees for printing are totally ridiculous for printing a sheet of paper but just don't get yourself in that situation! I had booked an exit row seat for an extra £10 which included priority boarding. I have to say it was worth it especially being tall. I arrived at the gate 45 minutes before the departure time to see a huge queue waiting for the boarding to start. The priority boarding queue was empty so I walked straight down and waited for around 15 minutes. Then a member of staff came over and said would you like to come forward we are ready after my pass was checked the barrier for the others was opened. I boarded the plane first after a few minutes wait at the bottom of the stairs of the plane and got settled whilst everyone else boarded. I'm not sure if this system works if there is a bus to catch to the plane? One benefit of being nearer to the front of the queue is getting seats with family/friends and having space to store luggage as many people we struggling to find places for their luggage once the plane was filling up. The flight was comfortable and crew were fairly friendly but seemed in a rush to serve drinks and were quite sharp with a few customers who were asking for a drink of water. The people in front were drinking their own alcohol and were sharply told that they couldn't consume their own alcohol on board. Overall I found the experience far better than expected even though the service of other airlines isn't present but the price was far far lower!

I was surprised by a big queue I was in that queue for about 10 minutes without moving anywhere a member of staff comes up and says (ladies and gentlemen we are evacuating to terminal 1 for security reasons) so I thought I was going to be late. I asked this gentlemen who said not to worry as all flights were delayed. When we got to terminal 1 after 10 minutes nothing had been said I went to see a member of staff and asked for information. I was told to sit and wait until I get a call. At 9.00 pm I went and asked again and I was told to wait 5 minutes later a lady came to me and asked if I was flying to Faro ans was told to follow her. There was when I found out I had missed the flight my plane had taken off at 7.45 pm. I fly with Ryanair regularly - very disappointed.,,,Economy Class,,,,2.0,4.0,4.0,,3.0,no,,

The 3.20pm flight eventually left at 10.20pm - 5 euro refreshment voucher. We queued for the flight at 7.05pm but that was cancelled for technical reasons. Passengers were offered transfers to flights to Manchester or Birmingham or the 10.20pm flight. I suppose not their fault but instead of asking passengers who wanted to go to Manchester to go to one desk and the others at another desk I was told ""first come first served"". Strange thing was the late flight could cater for all the passengers who were going to Liverpool so the technical fault saved them a flight to Liverpool. The 10.20pm flight was a nightmare with about twenty males all drunk and swearing and having to be advised by cabin staff to behave to be fair there was no alcohol sold on the flight. I will continue to use Ryanair as they are cheap but when possible travel on early morning flights you miss the stag/hen/football fans. I am looking forward to the allocation of seats so no more stampedes for the departure gates and they are only doing what Easyjet and Aer Lingus currently do.

Does the company not realise that not allocating seats will cause this? It flares up tempers and causes the whole plane load of passengers to be angry from the start. I stored my hand luggage in the overhead compartment and when I eventually got (semi) comfortable in my tiny seat I was asked by the cabin crew to move my bag from the overhead compartment to under my seat. I am 6.5ft tall and I explained this to the cabin crew that I would not have any room for my legs if I did this. Both the outgoing and return journeys were the same with absolutely no comfort whatsoever and incessant adverts being played to us offering to sell e-cigs or take part in exciting competitions. Any food on offer was overpriced. The return flight from Venice (the out of town airport) was akin to my Army days in Northern Ireland. Normally reasonable people cooped up like battery hens in a hot and stuffy room forced to stand for 2 hours waiting for Ryanair to sort their act out. After 2 hours the queue system we have ourselves put in place started to crumble and people began to flare up. Once the doors opened it was literally a stampede.

There was no inspection of seat belts by cabin staff before landing nor was he told to sit down. Our seats were near the emergency door where passengers are supposed to assist with evacuation. He was a big man who was in no state to assist and would have been a serious hindrance if there had been an emergency.

One thing which I really didn't like was the non-existent seat allocation. I felt as if I was part of a cattle herd trying to get on board as people had started to queue an hour before we were due to depart to ensure families got seats together. Ryanair overall is not terrible you get what you pay for. They are a budget no frills airline and I think people tend to forget about that.

I can't really remember but I think the original price on the internet was something like 47 pounds each. They added on a percentage because we booked with a credit card. They naturally added extra for baggage. We knew about this charge but of course Rynair have already worked out that international travellers are allowed 25 kilos but they only allow 15 kilos before excess baggage charges kick in.

At least I know when I fly with Ryanair the plane will be new and clean and the seats are comfortable. The food is acceptable and worth the money. They are nearly always on time. Flying with Ryanair is not a problem so long as you stick to the rules. Read everything on the booking form. The last two return flights to Spain cost me £89 including one piece of hold luggage.,,,Economy Class,,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,yes,,

My partner and myself both have eye problems and when I again requested some assistance I was very curtly told ""just put your glasses on"". We struggled to use the PC only to discover that the printer was in fact out of order. I was left with no option but to pay £140 for two boarding passes to be printed at the touch of a button. We eventually got ourselves and a single case weighing 20.03kg on our way to Corfu. I was therefore totally amazed when the same case minus two pair of shoes that were thrown away and toiletries that were used weighed 22.50kg.

On the return journey at the check in desk the staff asked if I wanted to put the guitar in the hold. I said no as its a valuable instrument. So they let me take it through. They did not inform me that I couldn't take it on the plane. As I was about to board a staff member told me that I couldn't take it on the plane and that it would have to go in the hold. Wasn't happy about that but there was no other option. She then charged me 60 Euro's for this even though I had already paid 50 to bring the guitar and the instrument was listed on my boarding pass. They didn't tell me at check in that it had to go in the hold and that I couldn't take it on the plane.

We had the most uncomfortable journey back to Stansted. We were unable to land at Stansted due to severe storms and were diverted to Birmingham. We sat on the plane at Birmingham for 2 hours while the Captain decided whether or not to fly back to Stansted. In the end he said we all had to leave the plane and coaches would be laid on to take us to Stansted. He had no idea when the coaches would arrive but said it would be hours not minutes. The crew as we got off were all laughing telling us to enjoy our coach ride. The crews need an awful lot of training. We had to get a taxi home in the end.,,,Economy Class,,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,no,,

I also checked on the screen upon entering the airport at approx. 10.15am and again no reported delays (only information was flight information and check-in desk to go to). Then after going through quite a security queue I'd been informed by another passenger that the flight had been delayed until 3pm which was confirmed on the displays. The scheduled time then varied from approx. 2.45 to 4pm changing quite regularly. So after a considerable time spent waiting at the airport the flight finally took off well after 3.15pm (by this time I was sitting on the plane and too tired to note the time of takeoff). I would recommend implementing a free beverage/drink for all customers in cases where any flight is more than 2 (or 2.5hrs) late. As this would show an acknowledgement the apology by the company and would not cost the company very much in terms of stock. In fact I'd say customers might then opt for seconds for which Ryanair could charge resulting in profitable sales overall. In addition no information was passed onto the customers as to the reason for this delay.,,,Economy Class,,,,4.0,2.0,0.0,,0.0,no,,

First time using Ryanair booked via an online holiday site and wasn't aware on booking that it was Ryanair. We had printed off our boarding passes and booked in hold luggage with smaller bags for hand luggage which fitted under our seats as due to the ridiculous size of hand luggage now allowed by most airlines have had problems in the past finding space above so I don't think it is worth the hassle this is by no means exclusive to Ryanair. Flight was good on time purchased only coffee at 3 euro don't think that is extortionate to pay. My complaints would be: 1) never having flew Ryanair I wasn't aware that it was unallocated seating and this caused a stampede for the seats. 2) due to the quick turnaround the plane was not cleaned between flights and the floor at my seat was covered in used tissue. From Dublin priority boarding did get on first but coming back in Ibiza everyone put onto a bus at the same time priority boarding let off a few minutes earlier but hadn't completed boarding when the next lot got off so I don't think I would pay for PB if flying with them in the future.

We had arrived 11 minutes before check- in was to close and no other passengers were queuing except ourselves yet the woman did not meet us with a professional greeting of good morning but barked at us 'You have one minute to process your baggage' and as my husband's suitcase was over the weight limit was unhelpful in resolving the situation and refused to allow us to pay a fine there but only when we had removed the offending items and struggled with them to the departure gate. My husband and I were stunned by this aggressive attitude and absolute lack of professionalism. The struggle to find available seats once we boarded was chaotic and with many crying children was a stressful experience.

None of the adults could be seated together which was not such a major issue but the Ryanair flight attendants (there for safety not service) thought it perfectly ok to seat a two year old 7 aisles from the nearest adult in our party.

With Ryanair all you have to do is follow some very basic rules and you wont have any trouble at all. Make sure you have booked in any hold luggage on line its much cheaper but you can take 10kg each as hand luggage6 of us so spreading it round saves you a lot of money. Also it amazes me when people cry when they have to pay the £60 if they haven't printed their boarding cards before hand. Why not? I do not have a printer so just pop down to a local library to print them out. Yes Ryanair is a bit like catching a bus and you just sit where there is space but so what flight times are not long haul and I'm sure you can put up with it for a few hours. There is a lot of selling during the flight but again so what. Don't buy anything if you don't want to. Food is a rip off agreed so I have never purchased anything.

If you forget the boarding pass that is printed by yourself there is a penalty of££70! The crew on both legs were surly. All they did on a 2.5 hour flight was to try and sell things.

Initially our bags were too large to fit through the allowance restrictions they had set so after shuffling the baggage a little they fit perfectly. The staff however showed no respect and little empathy with the situation of a mother carrying baby essentials in her purse. Of course we did not expect this to be the case but some nice treatment would have been much preferred to the screaming we endured about how the airline punctuality would be abused if we did not pay a fine. Before reshuffling the items in our bags the staff insisted that we pay the fine and requested that some of us be through to the plane. The children passed through (passport checked) and waited for the others only to have the staff lock the door on them separating them from parents simply to threaten our group that punctuality is crucial (even though we were boarding ahead of schedule). Unfortunately a handbag was taken (not disposed of but taken) and we made it to our seats. It seems that the staff of the airline are also not fond of people placing baggage in overhead compartments while safety demonstration is on as they requested to be seated and silent until takeoff.

As the line finally whittled down we decided to board. They don't turn on the air-conditioning until the plane is in the air. It was then we realised that the seats were not allocated first come first serve. We had to hold our carry on on our laps. I looked above me wondering why we couldn't put our carry on in the overhead compartments.

The total inflexibility on luggage weight is a sham and price gouge policy. We are both smallish people our carry on luggage was well under weight and one checked in bag (which of course we paid for) was 1 kg over bang another 20E ie it is per bag if hers was under and mine over you still pay on the one that is over. The flight crew were fine but the check in woman forgot to stamp my wife's boarding document so having gone through the queue we had to run back for that.

Being a first-time flyer I certainly don't have the experience to compare it with other airlines but I must say I don't get what all the fuss is about. Everyone seems to hate Ryanair and I had a very pleasant experience with them. No troubles with luggage we weren't even asked to measure it or weight it at boarding though I understand that was a stroke of luck. Staff were very polite and nice the only rudeness I witnessed were from the passengers themselves mainly some who had the luck of boarding with clearly oversized bags and then were surprised when they didn't fit in the compartments. Seats were comfortable they are no tighter that the average bus/train seat I was expecting much worse from all the reviews I read. Flights arrived earlier than the quoted time. They do play a lot of ads during the flight for their services but you aren't forced to buy anything and the staff doesn't get all in your face with it. All in all a very pleasant flight. I could have never afforded the trip if it wasn't for Ryanair. Just don't go to one of their flights with your mind set on trying to beat their system. If you want it cheap then you must abide by their rules. If you don't want to be bothered with that just go with the pricier airlines.,,,Economy Class,,,,4.0,5.0,0.0,,5.0,yes,,

We did not have the ability during our trip to remote Spain to pre-print the boarding passes thought this would not be a problem as we had flown with a world class budget airline Air Asia earlier in the year and they provide machines at the airports to check in or you could use you smart phone to display the barcode. Ryanair charged us 140 Euros for two boarding passes which took the girl at check-in 30 seconds to do. This was as much as the return fares from Stansted to Seville. Surely a charge must reflect the effort or cost associated with providing the service.

I boarded with my hand luggage having been meticulously measured and weighted by staff at the gate to find a free for all frenzy aboard. The over head luggage lockers were already full with many people still clutching bags in the aisle. Eventually after finding a vacant seat I asked the attendant where I should place my bag. I was told to put it under the seat in front of me I tried it didn't fit the attendant tried it still didn't fit so I was told to put it in the space between the seats. I questioned where I would then put my legs to be told that I would have to squeeze them in on top of my case. I said that this was unacceptable for a 2.5hr flight to be told that it was by own fault for not booking priority boarding and that my luggage would be off loaded if I did not comply! I refused pointing out my bag was within the correct size only after some adjacent passengers chipped in did the steward seek to put my bag elsewhere. On the way back the flight was not fully booked so staff sectioned off a few rows of seats just to make sure no one enjoyed any extra space they had not paid for - talk about no frills this is a whole new level.,,,Economy Class,,,,1.0,1.0,2.0,,2.0,no,,

Bring your own! No much room for leg! Come on! The journeys are always short how much room do you need for a 2 hr flight! Ryanair is convenient and cheap I am just a bit upset by the fact that some routes are not used in the winter!

Once we got on board only 4 rows were reserved and were told just find a seat after row 5 they are all free. As for coming back from Spain this week all of the Spanish people were pulled out of the long queue and moved to the front. Is it just English people who hate queuing. My girlfriend purchased a wooden gift which weighed no more than 2 pounds and 4 inches wide but it was 5 inches taller than the allowed case height. She had no hand luggage so thought it would be reasonable to take it on board. No it was classed as oversized and the woman in charge having no common sense wanted to charge us the sum of 60 Euro to stick a label on it. Once on board we found several seats still empty. Surely knowing this a bit of lenience would have been used. Where once on board the seat next to us was empty anyway so she had to leave it at the boarding gate.

Boarding gate opened about 17.30 - queue enormous as first come first served seating (unless you want to pay an extra £20 to reserve seat). Started boarding just after 6 - still boarding until about 7 - nightmare experience like herding animals. Held up by Spanish boarding staff team as told not allowed duty free bag as only one bag per customer in cabin - option pay extra 60 euro or put in cabin holdall - which we did but very stressful and which then made cabin bag too big. In the meantime large numbers of passengers passed us making us some of the last to enter plane - chaos on board with luggage and seating. BTW - 3 girls passed in front whilst we had duty free bag issue - they were carrying large shoulder handbags and wheeled cabin suitcases but not challenged at all by boarding team staff.

When I questioned the employee I was informed that I would have to pay 140 pounds in order to board the flight! We felt completely extorted by Ryanair's unscrupulous fees. After paying this fee we were then told that we could bring on 1 carry on bag-this would include a ladies handbag. We were instructed to place our carry on in this ridiculous contraption.

Well worth the £15 each way to not stand in the queue to board or worry about not being sat together. The seats are very narrow and each seat is separated by an immovable board so you can not straddle empty seats. Can not understand the reviews of people complaining about getting charged for not having their boarding pass. Ryanair email a week before to tell you that you must check in online. No excuse in the world will get you out of this but you are told by email. They also email you the day before the flight with the hand baggage measurements so no excuses there either. Where they do let themselves down is when the flights are delayed they offered no information whatsoever and there was a four hour wait of everyone staring at the screens. Planes are also often dirty due to them not being cleaned in the short turn around time. As long as you're flying to a proper airport and not a satellite (and end up paying for train/taxi/bus to get 60 miles+ to where you wanted to go!) one then they tend to be the cheapest by a long way as long as you play by the rules.

2208,2013-09-10,,South Africa,,Ryanair customer review,28 August I flew FR611 from London to Derry. Ryanair is the only airline flying this route. I therefore had no other option. Not travelling with a printer I needed to obtain a boarding pass at the auto check-in point at the airport. Ryanair refused to issue a boarding pass before I paid an additional 70 pounds almost the same price I paid for the ticket. I could have flown to Belfast and taken a 65 pounds taxi to Derry and still be better off. Attendants refusing to make eye contact said it was Ryanair policy and failure to pay would mean refusal to board yet I am still unsure how I was supposed to know this. It therefore came across as an express strategy to extort funds from passengers. Ryan Air's majority passengers being budget travellers makes this particularly mean- spirited. In all my travels I have never encountered any airline penalising customers for having to issue a boarding pass. I count myself lucky I never have to make use of Ryanair's services again and will actively dissuade anybody at risk of having to do so. The only unpleasant experience during a two week UK holiday and therefore one I recount often. I tried submitting a complaint to the airline directly but the only way of doing so is via snail mail.,,,Economy Class,,,,2.0,2.0,0.0,,1.0,no,,

2210,2013-09-10,,United Kingdom,,Ryanair customer review,Just been on holiday to Mallorca flew there with jet2 they were hassle free no problems and back with Ryanair. The aircraft Ryanair had us in felt old it looked like an old military transport inside. Staff were miserable especially at boarding when I tried helping my grandma put her hand luggage in the metal box sizer she got all uppity because I was blocking other passengers!

2211,2013-09-10,3,United Kingdom,,Ryanair customer review,Travelled to Rhodes from Stansted. Coming back was like a cattle market! All crammed into a waiting area so hot people pushing and queue jumping priority went through and some passengers that were not priority pushed their way in and were not stopped what is the point of paying when you can just push in? The aircraft was filthy and I had to sit with my feet in biscuit crumbs crisps bread crusts empty drink bottles - it was disgusting. Even when the seatbelt light was on people kept getting up and fiddling with their luggage. Also when the cabin bags were checked many of them pushed and shoved their bags in the testing rack - so much so that one man pulled his handle off and threw it across the airport floor! This testing of cabin bags does not work as several should have been in the hold but these people wanted to get away with paying and were arguing with the airport staff who jut let them through therefore Ryanair is losing out on payments for luggage and honest passengers are paying the price it needs to be sorted!,,,Economy Class,,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,,3.0,no,,
2212,2013-09-09,8,France,,Ryanair customer review,Took late flight Marseille - Palma on 737 800 with hand luggage only. There were no checks on size or weight. This was the same with a later Vueling flight I took except some of the passengers on that flight had more than one bag and others were plainly oversize! Departure and arrival were both a little late it had plainly been a long day. That said I have no complaints the fare was excellent value the red wine I purchased was not expensive and was good quality. This was my first experience with Ryanair and I am amazed that the fare was only a little more than the taxi fare from the airport into town.,,,Economy Class,,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,,5.0,yes,,
2213,2013-09-08,10,United Kingdom,,Ryanair customer review,Having used Ryanar for the past 3 yrs travelling to Tenerife Gran Canaria and Reus I we can only fully recommend and thank them for their fast efficient service. This is a budget airline and all extras are stated on booking on their website. For all those who wish to pay over the odds eg. extra £700 per family to fly to a destination then book Thomson or Thomas Cook however we used these one way to Reus and had an hour and half delay compared to every flight with Ryanair on time or usually 10 mins early. Some people just like to complain if you have a young family and want to sit together pre book seats or alternatively use Priority Boarding. I only wish Ryanair flew from Cardiff airport as we would save even more travel costs however it is worth the trip to Bristol as you could never fly a family of 4 from Cardiff for £700 to Canaries. Look forward to booking our next trip!,,,Economy Class,,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,,5.0,yes,,
2214,2013-09-08,,United Kingdom,,Ryanair customer review,Lanzarote to Manchester 6/9/13. When we arrived at Lanzarote airport informed of a delay. Baggage check in was an abomination with people having to open their luggage in the queues to take out items. When we eventually managed to get through the farce of baggage check in we had to open our hand luggage and remove laptops etc but at the same time had to take our child out of his buggy fold that up and put it on the belt then pass ourselves through security scanners whilst our 2 year old son was left to his own devices. Was waiting over half an our in a queue to actually get on the plane at the gate! On the flight only 1 end of toilets was available and people were having to queue behind the stewardesses selling and blocking the aisles! I would never recommend this airline! Don't pay to pre book seats as there was only 50 people on our flight going out so you could sit where you wanted. I'd rather pay more to go with a 'reputable' company.,,,Economy Class,,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,no,,

All the extra charges add up to the point where any saving is completely cancelled out. The staff couldn't care less about customers except as in flight cash cows and clearly the airline is not keen on attracting repeat business!! On both legs we were herded like cattle. Bordeaux luggage collection was unbearably slow and there is no access to toilet facilities in the big shed that passes for a terminal - Ryanair don't have access to the main airport terminal. On the return leg we were kept waiting for 40 minutes standing in a queue to board once again in the big shed with no apology for the delay no air conditioning or fresh air - gruesome!!

Staff were unhelpful and rude there was not enough room for the hand luggage on the plane so all 7 of our cases were put in the hold so we had no food or nappies. Staff were trying to sell things the whole flight we would probably have been better to reserve seats but for 8 people would not have then been a cost effective flight would not go with them again not one case for anyone was checked for either size or weight going to coming back maybe that's why they couldn't fit all the luggage in the cabin!,,,Economy Class,,,,2.0,1.0,0.0,,4.0,no,,

Stress re-packing our 52kg luggage into the correct number of bags after a day on the beach. Stress getting the hand luggage re-weighed. Stress standing crammed into a much too small area with all the other cattle. No facilities (refreshments or toilets) in 35 degree heat for 45 minutes. Stress barging through to the plane. Stress with the bright lights and constant announcements. No quick hostess service followed by a dimming of the lights so you can sleep. Awoken every 20 minutes to an automated scratchcard announcement. Uncomfortable seats which seem to have less padding than others. I landed with a headache which wrote off the following day.

Got on the plane after being pushed out of the way by hoards of mad passengers rushing for a seat only to find no seats available. Not a problem generally but when you have a six year old and only single seats available it was a bit tricky. The crew were useless and only seemed interested in pre-booked customers! Got a seat after walking up and down looking lost and no thanks to the crew! No issues going over but not good coming back. Why can't they let the kids on first. All they care about is money.

When we arrived in Palma on the return told we had to pay 60 euros each as we didn't have boarding passes. I had tried to check in online the day we flew and still there was no option to print any further boarding passes. She could see on her system that I had booked 7 seats and accessed the system but said at it was my fault and that it was an easy system. To add insult to injury I had a message on my home answer phone advising me I hadn't checked in this was left whilst I was still on holiday!,,,Economy Class,,,,2.0,2.0,2.0,,1.0,no,,

Aircraft was clean and tidy staff were efficient and polite. The food and beverages seemed adequate although we did not purchase any. We did not have reserved seats but we sat together on both journeys.

2228,2013-08-28,1,United Kingdom,,Ryanair customer review,Flew recently Edinburgh to Bordeaux. Outward was good although had to wait very long one for luggage. Return trip was awful. The new Billi section where the cheap airlines operate is once through security tiny poor toilet facilities and passengers crammed in like sardines. Announcements impossible to hear queues for the gates mingling with people in the shopping areas and once at the gates even tighter than sardines. I understand you have to know what you are doing and what to expect with cheap airlines but I will avoid them if I can in future. This experience was stressful and very uncomfortable. To make things worse the staff on return flight were unfriendly and the food was disgusting!,,,Economy Class,,,,1.0,2.0,1.0,,2.0,no,,

Checked in online arrived at Edinburgh to depart to find a massive slow moving queue. My 2 year old was getting tired and cranky. Then was told because my bag was 15.5kg and my wife's was 16kg we would be charged £100 for being over weight if we couldn't re-pack. The ignorant woman at check in couldn't care less about our upset child. We managed to get our luggage re-packed and I was told by another member of staff that my bag would be fine at 15.5kg. When getting onto the plane to get or free for all seat rush. My wife asks for assistance to find at least two seats together but the stewardess snootily told her to keep moving up the plane and find a seat. Luckily somebody moved so that she could sit with our child. Then you have to spend the rest of the flight listening to bored and rude cabin crew trying to sell things. Not the greatest start to our 1st family holiday. Have flown with Ryanair before to stags with friends with only hand luggage but will never use them again for a family holiday. They just don't care about their customers or the quality of your journey.,,,Economy Class,,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,no,,

The extra cost of printing a boarding pass and check in online was being handed out to a large group of passengers. Why does it cost so much to print a boarding pass and check in at the airport. The staff were rude and unhelpful to the point that I just wanted to get my money back for the flight and go home but - no refunds! If I were to treat people in my business like this I would have no customers. Terrible experience never again!,,,Economy Class,,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,no,,

Was dreading flights due to reading reviews - I've got to say if you stick to the guidelines and they do remind you with an e-mail reminding you of cabin bag size weight allowance and to print out boarding passes you can't go wrong. I saw myself the size of the bags people were trying to take on was never hand luggage. I paid to put my luggage in the hold but people were trying it on at the gate to get away with it and Ryanair don't move at all on the rules. I also paid for priority boarding as they only sell this to half of the seats on the plane you are almost guaranteed to sit together peace of mind your boarding 1st to save the bun fight when you get to the gate. Overall I would use them again. Stick within the rules and its not all that bad!,,,Economy Class,,,,4.0,4.0,0.0,,5.0,yes,,

Panic set in when we arrived at security and we had no bar-codes on boarding cards so couldn't be scanned but problem soon sorted by sending us through check in. Cabin crew helpful finding seats and storing bags that wouldn't fit in nearby lockers. Read the rules follow instructions and you won't have any trouble. No excuses as they make the conditions perfectly clear. Shall certainly be travelling with them again.,,,Economy Class,,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,,4.0,yes,,
2233,2012-09-03,2,United Kingdom,,Ryanair customer review,I thought that I was booking a budget airline and accept all that entails however as the final cost once all the 'extras' such as luggage were added I finally paid over 2500 for my families seats and may as well have gone on a better airline. The plane was clean and it took off and arrived on time. If you are travelling on a weekend break for 2 adults then I imagine it wouldn't be a problem just so long as you read all the small print and adhere to them very carefully however with 4 small children and no way to book a seat it was extremely stressful. I do not understand what they gain by using this system! Would go as far as to say that it is immoral that knowing that you cannot take drinks on board they do not supply water and a small bottle of water is £3! Staff were miserable and openly complained about other passengers whilst stood next to me. They enforce the rules when it suits them. They told a lady that she had to put her cardigan in the overhead lockers but the woman next to me had a handbag on her lap. I would rather stay at home then travel with them again.,,,Economy Class,,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,,3.0,no,,
2234,2012-09-03,8,United Kingdom,,Ryanair customer review,July 2012 Bristol to Tenerife. We are a family of 4 (2 adults and 2 children 10 and 14). We knew that seats weren't allocated but as long as one of our kids was sat with us each we didn't mind. Check in was quick and easy at Bristol as was boarding. Boarding Passes - it clearly states that you have to print them off prior to travelling and you have 14 days to print off your returns if you read the terms and conditions this is quite clear. Yes food and drink is a little expensive but I have never know an airline yet who sell cheap food and drink if you don't like it then buy it in departures prior to boarding. We experience some bad turbulence when landing which meant we had to take off again and land in the North of the Island. After sitting on the tarmac for 30 minutes we were told that buses were waiting for us at the front of the terminal to take us down to Tenerife South other than a little bit of confusion with the staff at the airport this went quite smoothly. People were moaning and complaining about Ryanair and standing in the aisle of the plane when we had all been asked to remain seated until further instructions were given but all I can say is I was happy to land safely rather than Ryanair attempting to land in such bad conditions and put everyone at risk! Staff were friendly enough the return flight was good and they got us back slightly earlier than planned. The plane did not seem anymore uncomfortable than others we have travelled on and it was clean. Lastly if you have young children I recommend you pay for priority boarding or make every effort to get to the front of the queue before boarding if you all want to sit together.,,,Economy Class,,,,4.0,3.0,3.0,,4.0,yes,,
2235,2012-09-03,8,Spain,,Ryanair customer review,Ryanair is good for its destinations the small airports closer to where you want to go. In the bigger airports their slots are obviously the cheapest and therefore the most inconvenient for passengers. The flights are cramped and the boarding process is very slow. Staff are often pleasant. The flights are not necessarily the cheapest; in domestic Spanish flights for instance by the time you have added a reserved seat and luggage in the hold you can travel cheaper and more comfortably with Iberia or Air Europa. Flights from Spain however to Baden Airpark or Ancona for instance are convenient because they are not routed through hubs with long conveyor belt waiting-times and one can often find an airport close to one's destination.,,,Economy Class,,,,2.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0,yes,,
2236,2012-09-03,1,United Kingdom,,Ryanair customer review,Bristol - Malaga. Return flight was booked for family of 4 with 2 bags checked in (already charged £100 for privilege of taking 2 hold bags). For the return my wife had to leave a few days early due to unforeseen circumstances so she departed on a different flight from Seville. At Malaga airport tried to check in with the 2 kids and 2 bags - only to be told had to pay an extra 100 Euros on the spot to 'transfer' one of the bags from my wife to one of the children. Otherwise would not be able to take it. Means I paid approx £130 for the one suitcase plus £50 for the other. Absolute rip off; and the flights were not exactly cheap even before the add-ons.

What I have noticed the same problems occur time and time again. People don't read the rules you don't get something for nothing you know that with Ryanair - accept it. Why do people with children think they have the right to complain when they saunter on to the plane at the last minute and wonder why the are unable to sit together. People get to the check and have to start unpacking cases because they cant be bothered to weigh there luggage. Ryanair is the cheapest not the best I accept that but most of the problems I have seen are caused by the passengers themselves.,,,Economy Class,,,,4.0,4.0,1.0,,4.0,yes,,

I paid for seat for my little girl however was expected to keep her on my lap as she wasn't allowed to have her own. It would be great if I could just lay her down surely we would both be more comfortable. Also women with kids or pregnant get no priority at the boarding gates staff are rude and treated us as a load not a human beings talking down to us. At the end of the day we are paying customers so show us some respect! Will not fly with them again.,,,Economy Class,,,,2.0,1.0,3.0,,1.0,no,,

Everyone else had huge rucksacks that were no way acceptable - and nobody checked at either end! As for families with children and push chairs (have you seen the size of them nowadays) I would ban them from cabins at any price. One saving grace however was that seat backs are fixed in the upright position. Will I travel again with them.

I ended up having to stay at home and lost parking and hotel deposit. Since June I have my flights to Rimini from Stansted booked and confirmed for Christmas. My family who live in Rimini have just informed me that Ryanair is stopping flying there from September so I phoned customer service to find out. I was told yes it was true and asked if I wanted a refund. Is that all you've got to say I inquired. After a long silence I was asked again if I wanted a refund; there was no explanation. To summarize Ryanair know that they are not going to fly into Rimini at Christmas but have no intention on informing the poor passengers who are looking forward to being there for Christmas. Not only they are holding on to everyone's money. They will hold you to ransom nearer the time leaving you no choice but to fly to Bologna or Ancona at inflated prices.,,,Economy Class,,,,4.0,4.0,1.0,,4.0,no,,

The next flight from Limoges to Stansted with availability was 3 days later. So we accepted a flight to Leeds the following day. That was all that was done for us we had to arrange our own overnight accommodation transport to and from the airport etc. My advice is if you travel with Ryanair: Make sure you have access to the internet because you need to react pretty quickly when the flight is cancelled as the airports are usually in the middle of nowhere. Know the location of the other airports Ryanair operate. We were offered a flight from Bergerac the next day but the airport staff could not tell us how to get there by train. Don't book stuff for the day after your arrival. There were people in the queue with connecting flights tickets for the Olympics that they could not use. Based on the above I would not travel again with Ryanair if I was travelling to a tight schedule. In total we got home 26 hrs after we planned.,,,Economy Class,,,,3.0,3.0,0.0,,2.0,no,,

It was now the time for the safety announcements prior to take off I do understand that this is important however I have never seen such miserable faces from the cabin staff. We were sitting in row five and it took nearly 1hr to get served I think mainly because they had to keep explaining what they had run out of even before we took off. The list was endless of what they hadn't got. When it was our turn I ordered 1 bottle of water a whisky and a can of coke I was taken back a little when they said that's 11 Euros. I quickly put my money back in my pocket. All they wanted to do was to sell scratch cards and smokeless cigarettes. Overall not impressed at all and will never travel Ryanair in the future. One final thing. Budget airline? My tickets where certainly not cheap or even reasonable.,,,Economy Class,,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,no,,
2245,2012-08-28,1,United Kingdom,,Ryanair customer review,Stansted to Pula. Tried to adhere to all rules and regulations but failed to print boarding passes for return journey and hence fined €240 for family of four. This was a genuine error caused by my printing off the outbound boarding passes at too early a stage in my eagerness to do all correctly at which time unable to print for return. Erroneously assumed outbound copies and itinerary would suffice. Hold my hands up and agree nominal fine should be payable but believe that €60 per person is totally disproportionate to administration involved for the error. Walked 5 metres handed over credit card and after a minutes transaction and €240 pound payment returned to check in and allowed to board!

On our way home the check in lady at Malta said it was going to cost us 290 euros to get home due to no boarding cards even though in front of her on a check list were all the names of passengers and their luggage. After several words and a lot of shouting I paid the money having no other choice. This airline ruined a holiday that was otherwise brilliant and showed no remorse to me and several other unfortunate passengers.

Budget flying is fine I was lucky enough to sit in the aisle seat with my baby and my 7 year old sat on the other side of the aisle. I even paid for priority boarding on the way back to give myself just 3 minutes to find a seat next to my own child and get my bags and it made no difference. They put the gate number up people run to the gate 12 minutes walk away they start boarding and I am still trying to push the pram to the gate. A fellow passenger kindly offered to hold my baby while I collapsed the pram at the bottom of the stairs. I still struggled to get on and get seated people pushing past me. I will be seeking my money back for 'priority boarding'. If you have a small child or infant it is not worth it. I flew long haul from Australia with a baby and 7 year old 27 hours worth of traveling and not once felt as stressed and helpless as I did flying Ryanair.,,,Economy Class,,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,no,,
2248,2012-08-23,2,United Kingdom,,Ryanair customer review,Stansted to Barcelona. Fine going there. Horrendous treatment on boarding for the return flight. My daughters under 16 years of age were summoned to pay 50 euros each for their hand luggage even though the cases fit the dimensions specified. Staff started to process the £50 fines without asking for their ages or to speak with their parent then demanded payment. Really put a dampener on the whole trip. First and last time we fly with Ryanair.,,,Economy Class,,,,1.0,2.0,0.0,,1.0,no,,
